## talk-codebase 
[![Node.js Package](https://github.com/rsaryev/talk-codebase/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rsaryev/talk-codebase/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml)

* Simple configuration in just a couple of clicks
* Talk-codebase is a tool that allows you to converse with your codebase using LLMs (Large Language Models) to answer your queries.
* It supports offline code processing using [GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all) without sharing your code with third parties, or you can use OpenAI if privacy is not a concern for you.
* Talk-codebase is still under development, but it is a tool that can help you to improve your code. It is only recommended for educational purposes and not for production use.

## Installation

To install talk-codebase, you need to have:

* Python 3.9
* An OpenAI API [api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

```bash
# Install talk-codebase
pip install talk-codebase

# If you want some files to be ignored, add them to .gitignore.
# Once `talk-codebase` is installed, you can use it to chat with your codebase in the current directory by running the following command:
talk-codebase chat .
```

## Reset configuration
```bash
# If you want to reset the configuration, you can run the following command:
talk-codebase configure
```

## Advanced configuration

You can also edit the configuration manually by editing the `~/.config.yaml` file.
If for some reason you cannot find the configuration file, just run the tool and at the very beginning it will output
the path to the configuration file.

```yaml
# The OpenAI API key. You can get it from https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys
api_key: sk-xxx

# Configuration for chunking
chunk_overlap: 50
chunk_size: 500

# Configuration for sampling
k: 4
max_tokens: 1048

# Configuration for the LLM model
# Name of model to use. You can find the list of available models here: https://gpt4all.io/models
openai_model_name: gpt-3.5-turbo
# Type of model to use. You can choose between `openai` and `local`.
model_type: openai
# Name of local model. If you want to use a local model, you need to specify the name of it.
local_model_name: orca-mini-7b.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin
# Path to local model. If you want to use a local model, you need to specify the path to it.
model_path: 'absolute path to local model'
```

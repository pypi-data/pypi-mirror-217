# MathKit - A Mathematical Library Made Simple

**MathKit is a Python library that provides various mathematical functions and utilities for performing common mathematical calculations.**

## Example Short Usage as a calulator

```python
from mathkit import main
main()
```

## Example Long Usage- Old 

```python
from mathkit import *

print("Welcome to the Math Library!")
print("1. Addition")
print("2. Subtraction")
print("3. Multiplication")
print("4. Division")
print("5. Modulas")
print("6. Power")
print("7. Square")
print("8. Cube")
print("9. Square Root")
print("10. Cube Root")
print("11. Factorial")
print("12. Percentage")
print("13. LCM")
print("14. HCF")
print("15. Logarithm")
print("16. Exit")

choice = int(input("Enter your choice: "))

if choice == 1:
    add()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 2:
    sub()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 3:
    mul()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 4:
    div()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 5:
    mod()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 6:
    power()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 7:
    sqr()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 8:
    cube()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 9:
    sqrt()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 10:
    cbrt()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 11:
    fact()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 12:
    percentage()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 13:
    lcm()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 14:
    hcf()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 15:
    log()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 16:
    exit()
else:
    print("Invalid choice!")
    print("Press Enter to continue")
    input()
```

## Example Usage If you decide to predefine numbers

```python
import mathkit

mathkit.add(5, 3)  # Output: Your answer is 8
mathkit.cbrt(27)  # Output: The cube root of 27 is 3.0
mathkit.div(10, 2)  # Output: Your answer is 5.0
mathkit.fact(5)  # Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
mathkit.hcf(24, 36)  # Output: The H.C.F. of 24 and 36 is 12
mathkit.lcm(12, 18)  # Output: The LCM of 12 and 18 is 36
mathkit.log(100)  # Output: Logarithm of 100 (base e) is 4.605...
mathkit.mod(10, 3)  # Output: Your answer is 1
mathkit.mul(4, 5)  # Output: Product = 20
mathkit.per(50, 10)  # Output: 10 percent of 50 is 5
mathkit.power(2, 3)  # Output: The answer is: 8
mathkit.sqrt(25)  # Output: Square root of 25 is 5.0
mathkit.sqr(4)  # Output: The square of 4 is 16
mathkit.sub(8, 3)  # Output: Your answer is 5

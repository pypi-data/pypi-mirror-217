elif choice == 2:
    sub()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 3:
    mul()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 4:
    div()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 5:
    mod()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 6:
    power()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 7:
    sqr()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 8:
    cube()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 9:
    sqrt()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 10:
    cbrt()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 11:
    fact()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 12:
    percentage()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 13:
    lcm()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 14:
    hcf()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 15:
    log()  # You can predefine a number by looking at the syntax given below.
elif choice == 16:
    exit()

```

## Example Usage If you decide to predefine numbers

```python
add(5, 3)  # Output: Your answer is 8
cbrt(27)  # Output: The cube root of 27 is 3.0
div(10, 2)  # Output: Your answer is 5.0
fact(5)  # Output: The factorial of 5 is 120
hcf(24, 36)  # Output: The H.C.F. of 24 and 36 is 12
lcm(12, 18)  # Output: The LCM of 12 and 18 is 36
log(100)  # Output: Logarithm of 100 (base e) is 4.605...
mod(10, 3)  # Output: Your answer is 1
mul(4, 5)  # Output: Product = 20
per(50, 10)  # Output: 10 percent of 50 is 5
power(2, 3)  # Output: The answer is: 8
sqrt(25)  # Output: Square root of 25 is 5.0
sqr(4)  # Output: The square of 4 is 16
sub(8, 3)  # Output: Your answer is 5

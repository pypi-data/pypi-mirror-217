methane, from biomass:
  - production of 2 wt-% potassium iodide solution
  - biogas upgrading - sewage sludge - amine scrubbing - best
  - Biomethane, gaseous, 5 bar, from sewage sludge fermentation, at fuelling station
methane, synthetic:
  - methane, from electrochemical methanation, with carbon from atmospheric CO2 capture
  - methane, from biological methanation, with carbon from atmospheric CO2 capture

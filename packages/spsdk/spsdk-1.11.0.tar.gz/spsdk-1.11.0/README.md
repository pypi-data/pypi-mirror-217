**i.Mx RT 1050**

To run examples using i.MX RT 1050 you need to download a flashloader:
- Go to: https://www.nxp.com/webapp/sps/download/license.jsp?colCode=IMX-RT1050-FLASHLOADER
- Review the license agreement, download and unzip the package
- Convert the elf file into bin (For this operation you need to have MCUXpresso IDE, IAR or Keil)
  - run ```python tools\flashloader_converter.py --elf-path <path/to/flashloader.elf> --ide-type <mcux | iar | keil> --ide-path <path/to/IDE/install/folder```

scikit-tree
===========

scikit-tree is a scikit-learn compatible API for building state-of-the-art decision trees. These include unsupervised trees, oblique trees, uncertainty trees, quantile trees and causal trees.

Tree-models have withstood the test of time, and are consistently used for modern-day data science and machine learning applications. They especially perform well when there are limited samples for a problem and are flexible learners that can be applied to a wide variety of different settings, such as tabular, images, time-series, genomics, EEG data and more.

We welcome contributions for modern tree-based algorithms. We use Cython to achieve fast C/C++ speeds, while abiding by a scikit-learn compatible (tested) API. Moreover, our Cython internals are easily extensible because they follow the internal Cython API of scikit-learn as well.

**Submodule dependency on a fork of scikit-learn**
Due to the current state of scikit-learn's internal Cython code for trees, we have to instead leverage a maintained fork of scikit-learn at https://github.com/neurodata/scikit-learn, where specifically, the `fork` branch is used to build and install this repo. We keep that fork well-maintained and up-to-date with respect to the main sklearn repo. The only difference is the refactoring of the `tree/` submodule. This fork is used internally under the namespace ``sktree._lib.sklearn``. It is necessary to use this fork for anything related to:

- `RandomForest*`
- `ExtraTrees*`
- or any importable items from the `tree/` submodule, whether it is a Cython or Python object

If you are developing for scikit-tree, we will always depend on the most up-to-date commit of `https://github.com/neurodata/scikit-learn/submodulev2` as a submodule within scikit-tee. This branch is consistently maintained for changes upstream that occur in the scikit-learn tree submodule. This ensures that our fork maintains consistency and robustness due to bug fixes and improvements upstream.

Documentation
=============

See here for the documentation for our dev version: https://docs.neurodata.io/scikit-tree/dev/index.html

Why oblique trees and why trees beyond those in scikit-learn?
=============================================================
In 2001, Leo Breiman proposed two types of Random Forests. One was known as ``Forest-RI``, which is the axis-aligned traditional random forest. One was known as ``Forest-RC``, which is the random oblique linear combinations random forest. This leveraged random combinations of features to perform splits. [MORF](1) builds upon ``Forest-RC`` by proposing additional functions to combine features. Other modern tree variants such as Canonical Correlation Forests (CCF), or unsupervised random forests are also important at solving real-world problems using robust decision tree models.

Installation
============
Our installation will try to follow scikit-learn installation as close as possible, as we contain Cython code subclassed, or inspired by the scikit-learn tree submodule.

AS OF NOW, scikit-tree is in development stage and the installation is still finicky due to the upstream scikit-learn's stalled refactoring PRs of the tree submodule. Once those are merged, the installation will be simpler. The current recommended installation is done locally with meson.

Dependencies
------------

We minimally require:

    * Python (>=3.8)
    * numpy
    * scipy
    * scikit-learn >= 1.3

Installation with Pip
---------------------

    pip install sktree

Building locally with Meson (RECOMMENDED)
-----------------------------------------
Make sure you have the necessary packages installed

    # install build dependencies
    pip install numpy scipy meson ninja meson-python Cython scikit-learn scikit-learn-tree

    # you may need these optional dependencies to build scikit-learn locally
    conda install -c conda-forge joblib threadpoolctl pytest compilers llvm-openmp

We use the ``spin`` CLI to abstract away build details:

    # run the build using Meson/Ninja
    ./spin build
    
    # you can run the following command to see what other options there are
    ./spin --help
    ./spin build --help
    
    # For example, you might want to start from a clean build
    ./spin build --clean
    
    # or build in parallel for faster builds
    ./spin build -j 2

    # you will need to double check the build-install has the proper path 
    # this might be different from machine to machine
    export PYTHONPATH=${PWD}/build-install/usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages

    # run specific unit tests
    ./spin test -- sktree/tree/tests/test_tree.py

    # you can bring up the CLI menu
    ./spin --help

You can also do the same thing using Meson/Ninja itself. Run the following to build the local files:

    # generate ninja make files
    meson build --prefix=$PWD/build

    # compile
    ninja -C build

    # install scikit-tree package
    meson install -C build

    export PYTHONPATH=${PWD}/build/lib/python3.9/site-packages

    # to check installation, you need to be in a different directory
    cd docs;  
    python -c "from sktree import tree"
    python -c "import sklearn; print(sklearn.__version__);"

Alternatively, you can use editable installs

    pip install --no-build-isolation --editable .

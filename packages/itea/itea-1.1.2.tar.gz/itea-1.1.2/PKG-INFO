itea is a python implementation of the Interaction-Transformation Evolutionary
Algorithm described in the paper "Franca, F., & Aldeia, G. (2020).
Interaction-Transformation Evolutionary Algorithm for Symbolic Regression.
Evolutionary Computation, 1-25."

The Interaction-Transformation (IT) representation is a step towards obtaining
simpler and more interpretable results, searching in the mathematical
equations space by means of an evolutionary strategy.

Together with ITEA for Classification and Regression, we provide a
model-specific explainer based on the Partial Effects to help users get a
better understanding of the resulting expressions.

This implementation is based on the scikit-learn package and the implementations
of the estimators follow their guidelines.


> **OBS:** There also exists a [high-performing Haskell implementation (that comes with a python wrapper)](https://github.com/folivetti/ITEA) by [@folivetti](https://github.com/folivetti/ITEA).

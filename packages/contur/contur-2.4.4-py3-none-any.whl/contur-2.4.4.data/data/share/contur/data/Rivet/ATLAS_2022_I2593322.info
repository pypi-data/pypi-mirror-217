Description:
  'Cross-sections for the production of a $Z$ boson in association
  with two photons are measured in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass
  energy of $13 \, \mathrm{TeV}$. The data used correspond to an integrated luminosity
  of $139 \, \mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ recorded by the ATLAS experiment during Run 2 of the LHC.
  The measurements use the electron and muon decay channels of the $Z$ boson, and a
  fiducial phase-space region where the photons are not radiated from the leptons.
  The integrated $Z(\rightarrow\ell\ell)\gamma\gamma$ cross-section is measured with
  a precision of $12\%$ and differential cross-sections are measured as a function of
  six kinematic variables of the $Z\gamma\gamma$ system. The data are compared with predictions
  from MC event generators which are accurate to up to next-to-leading order in QCD.
  The cross-section measurements are used to set limits on the coupling strengths of
  dimension-8 operators in the framework of an effective field theory.'

# Additional or Modified Rivet info

Staging area for new or modified rivet routines (and REF data, metadata) before they have moved into
a rivet release.

ATLAS_2013_I1190187.yoda and CMS_2019_I1744604.yoda.gz are both here permanently because
we use the correlation matrixces in HEPData but they are not in the Rivet 3.1.7 REF data files.

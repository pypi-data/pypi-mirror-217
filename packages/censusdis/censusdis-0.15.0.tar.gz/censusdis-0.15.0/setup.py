If you want to try it out for yourself, the README.md\ncontains links that let you run the tutorial notebooks live on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) in your browser without needing to set up a\nlocal development environment or download or install any code.\n\n## Introduction \n\n`censusdis` is a package for discovering, loading, analyzing, and computing\ndiversity, integration, and segregation metrics\nto U.S. Census demographic data. It is designed to be intuitive and Pythonic,\nbut give users access to the full collection of data and maps the US Census\npublishes via their APIs. It also avoids hard-coding metadata\nabout U.S. Census variables, such as their names, types, and\nhierarchies in groups. Instead, it queries this from the \nU.S. Census API. This allows it to operate over a large set\nof datasets and years, likely including many that don\'t\nexist as of time of this writing. It also integrates\ndownloading and merging the geometry of geographic \ngeometries to make plotting data and derived metrics simple\nand easy. Finally, it interacts with the `divintseg`\npackage to compute diversity and integration metrics.\n\nThe design goal of `censusdis` are discussed in more\ndetail in [design-goals.md](./design-goals.md).\n\n> ### I\'m not sure I get it. Show me what it can do.\n> \n> The [Nationwide Diversity and Integration](./notebooks/Nationwide%20Diversity%20and%20Integration.ipynb)\n> notebook demonstrates how we can download, process, and \n> plot a large amount of US Census demographic data quickly\n> and easily to produce compelling results with just a few\n> lines of code.\n\n> ### I\'m sold! I want to dive right in!\n> \n> To get straight to installing and trying out\n> code hop over to our \n> [Getting Started](https://censusdis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)\n> guide.\n\n`censusdis` lets you quickly and easily load US Census data and make plots like \nthis one:\n\n![Median income by block group in GA](docs/_static/images/sample02.png)\n\nWe downloaded the data behind this plot, including\nthe geometry of all the block groups, with a\nsingle call:\n\n```python\nimport censusdis.data as ced\nfrom censusdis.states import STATE_GA\n\n# This is a census variable for median household income.\n# See https://api.census.gov/data/2020/acs/acs5/variables/B19013_001E.html\nMEDIAN_HOUSEHOLD_INCOME_VARIABLE = "B19013_001E"\n\ngdf_bg = ced.download(\n    "acs/acs5",  # The American Community Survey 5-Year Data\n    2020,\n    ["NAME", MEDIAN_HOUSEHOLD_INCOME_VARIABLE],\n    state=STATE_GA,\n    block_group="*",\n    with_geometry=True\n)\n```\n\nSimilarly, we can download data and geographies, do a little\nanalysis on our own using familiar [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)\ndata frame operations, and plot graphs like these\n\n![Percent of population identifying as white by county](docs/_static/images/sample03.png)\n![Integration is SoMa](docs/_static/images/sample00.png)\n\n## Modules\n\nThe public modules that make up the `censusdis` package are\n\n| Module                | Description                                                                                                   |\n|-----------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `censusdis.geography` | Code for managing geography hierarchies in which census data is organized.                                    | \n| `censusdis.data`      | Code for fetching data from the US Census API, including managing datasets, groups, and variable hierarchies. |\n| `censusdis.maps`      | Code for downloading map data from the US, caching it locally, and using it to render maps.                   |\n| `censusdis.states`    | Constants defining the US States. Used by the three other modules.                                            |\n\n## Demonstration Notebooks\n\nThere are several demonstration notebooks available to illustrate how `censusdis` can\nbe used. They are found in the \n[notebook](https://github.com/vengroff/censusdis/tree/main/notebooks) \ndirectory of the source code.\n\nThe demo notebooks include\n\n| Notebook Name                                                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| [ACS Comparison Profile.ipynb](./notebooks/ACS%20Comparison%20Profile.ipynb)                                | Load and plot American Community Survey (ACS) Comparison Profile data at the state level.                                                                                            |\n| [ACS Data Profile.ipynb](./notebooks/ACS%20Data%20Profile.ipynb)                                            | Load and plot American Community Survey (ACS) Data Profile data at the state level.                                                                                                  |\n| [ACS Demo.ipynb](./notebooks/ACS%20Demo.ipynb)                                                              | Load American Community Survey (ACS) Detail Table data for New Jersey and plot diversity statewide at the census block group level.                                                  |\n| [ACS Subject Table.ipynb](./notebooks/ACS%20Subject%20Table.ipynb)                                          | Load and plot American Community Survey (ACS) Subject Table data at the state level.                                                                                                 |\n| [Block Groups in CBSAs.ipynb](./notebooks/Block%20Groups%20in%20CBSAs.ipynb)                                | Load and spatially join on-spine and off-spine geographies and plot the results on a map.                                                                                            |\n| [Data With Geometry.ipynb](./notebooks/Data%20With%20Geometry.ipynb)                                          | Load American Community Survey (ACS) data for New Jersey and plot diversity statewide at the census block group level.                                                               |\n| [Exploring Variables.ipynb](./notebooks/Exploring%20Variables.ipynb)                                        | Load metatdata on a group of variables, visualize the tree hierarchy of variables in the group, and load data from the leaves of the tree.                                           |\n| [Getting Started Examples.ipynb](./notebooks/Getting%20Started%20Examples.ipynb)                            | Sample code from the [Getting Started](https://censusdis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) guide.                                                                                 |                                                         |\n| [Nationwide Diversity and Integration.ipynb](./notebooks/Nationwide%20Diversity%20and%20Integration.ipynb)  | Load nationwide demographic data, compute diversity and integration, and plot.                                                                                                       |\n| [Map Demo.ipynb](./notebooks/Map%20Demo.ipynb)                                                              | Demonstrate loading at plotting maps of New Jersey at different geographic granularity.                                                                                              |\n| [Map Geographies.ipynb](./notebooks/Map%20Geographies.ipynb)                                                | Illustrates a large number of different map geogpraphies and how to load them.                                                                                                       |\n| [Population Change 2020-2021.ipynb](./notebooks/Population%20Change%202020-2021.ipynb)                      | Track the change in state population from 2020 to 2021 using ACS5 data.                                                                                                              |\n| [PUMS Demo.ipynb](./notebooks/PUMS%20Demo.ipynb)                                                            | Load Public-Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) data for Massachusetts and plot it.                                                                                                         |\n| [Querying Available Data Sets.ipynb](./notebooks/Querying%20Available%20Data%20Sets.ipynb)                  | Query all available data sets.

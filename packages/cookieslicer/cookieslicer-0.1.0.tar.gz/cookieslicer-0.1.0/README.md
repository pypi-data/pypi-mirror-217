## How To Use This Package

NOTE: This project is under development.  More to come in the following weeks.

### Examples

For concrete examples that show the power of this library package, please consult
the [Examples Document](./docs/examples.md).  If you come up with a normal example
of how to use our package that we have missed, or come up with a novel example of
how to use our package, please file an issue using the process below and let us
know. From our experience, one example can often paint a picture of how to use our
project that is difficult to explain clearly with just words.

## Issues and Future Plans

If you would like to report an issue with the library or the documentation, please
file an issue [using GitHub](https://github.com/jackdewinter/cookieslicer/issues).
Please remember to fill in as much information as possible including a good, repeatable
pattern for reproducing the issue.  Do not overflow us with too much information,
but provide us with enough information to make the problem evident to us.

If you would like to us to implement a feature that you believe is important, please
file an issue [using GitHub](https://github.com/jackdewinter/cookieslicer/issues)
that includes what you want to add, why you want to add it, and why it is important
to you, and how you think it will help others.  We truly want to listen to what
you see as a good feature, so please do not be upset if we say "no" or "let me
think about it".

Please note that the issue you file will usually be the start of a conversation,
so be ready for more questions.  If you have any Python developer skills, please
mention that as well.  The conversations about "hey, can you..." is a lot different
than "if I do... can I add it to the project?".

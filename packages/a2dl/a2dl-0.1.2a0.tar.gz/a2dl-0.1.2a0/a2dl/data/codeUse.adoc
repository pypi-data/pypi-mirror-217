# Create new Icon from a adoc file
my_icon = Diagicon(name='tigabeatz')
x = my_icon.from_adoc('./data/example.adoc')

# Create new Library, add the Icon and export as file
my_library = Diaglibrary()
my_library.icons.append(my_icon)
my_library.write('./data/test-generated-library.xml')

# Create a Library from a folder structure full of asciidoc files and write as file
my_library2 = Diaglibrary()
my_library2.from_folder('./data')
my_library2.write('./data/test-generated-library.xml')

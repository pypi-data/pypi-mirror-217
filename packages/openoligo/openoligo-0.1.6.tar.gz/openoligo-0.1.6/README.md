OpenOligo is an open-source platform for programmatically interacting with and managing DNA synthesis processes.

## Getting Started
```sh
pip install openoligo
```

### A simple Example

```py
import asyncio

from openoligo.instrument import Instrument
from openoligo.protocols.dna_synthesis import synthesize
from openoligo.seq import Seq


inst = Instrument()

try:
    asyncio.run(synthesize(inst, Seq("ATCGAAATTTTT")))
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Keyboard interrupt received, exiting...")
```

## Firmware
The firmware for OpenOligo is composed of 
- OpenOligo Library
- API server (part of OpenOligo Library)
- In a minimal linux image ([OligoOS](https://github.com/Technoculture/OligoOs/tree/dev))

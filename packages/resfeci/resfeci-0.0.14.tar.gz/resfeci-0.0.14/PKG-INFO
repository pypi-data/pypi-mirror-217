# ResFeci for Excel

In it's current state, this package will allow you to quickly split a single Excel sheet into either separate tabs within the same report or into different Excel reports.  For example, if Column 'B' of your Excel report contains "Names" and "Jack" appears in 3 rows and "Jill" appears in 2, then, this will split the report into 2 separate reports (one for only Jack's rows and another for only Jill's)---or, this will create a new report tabs entitled "Jack" and "Jill".

**IMPORTANT: Your sheet must contain a header row to function properly!**

from resfeci import excel_split

excel_split.split_sheet(split_type= 'separate_files' , input_report_path= 'PATH_TO_REPORT.xlsx' , column_number_to_split_by=2)

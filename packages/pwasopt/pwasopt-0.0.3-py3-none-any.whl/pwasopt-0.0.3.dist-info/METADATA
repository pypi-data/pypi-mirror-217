# Global and Preference-based Optimization with Mixed Variables using Piecewise Affine Surrogates (PWAS/PWASp)

We propose a novel surrogate-based global optimization algorithm, called PWAS, based on constructing a piecewise affine surrogate of the objective function over feasible samples. We introduce two types of exploration functions to efficiently search the feasible domain via mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solvers. We also provide a preference-based version of the algorithm, called PWASp, which can be used when only pairwise comparisons between samples can be acquired while the objective function
remains unquantified. For more details on the method, please read our paper [Global and Preference-based Optimization with Mixed Variables using Piecewise Affine Surrogates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04686).

# PET Dataset Goldstandard and Baselines predictions visualizers

This package provides two graphical interfaces to visualize the [PET dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/patriziobellan/PET) goldstandard annotations and the baselines predictions.

## The PET Dataset

**Abstract**. *Process extraction from text is an important task of process discovery, for which various approaches have been developed in recent years. However, in contrast to other information extraction tasks, there is a lack of gold-standard corpora of business process descriptions that are carefully annotated with all the entities and relationships of interest. Due to this, it is currently hard to compare the results obtained by extraction approaches in an objective manner, whereas the lack of annotated texts also prevents the application of data-driven information extraction methodologies, typical of the natural language processing field. Therefore, to bridge this gap, we present the PET dataset, a first corpus of business process descriptions annotated with activities, gateways, actors, and flow information. We present our new resource, including a variety of baselines to benchmark the difficulty and challenges of business process extraction from text. PET can be accessed via  [huggingface.co/datasets/patriziobellan/PET](https://pdi.fbk.eu/pet-dataset/huggingface.co/datasets/patriziobellan/PET)*

### Baseline Predictor Agreement Interface

This visualizer shows the agreement between the baseline predictors and the goldstandard annotations.

```python
from Visualizers.BaselinePredictorAgreementInterface import Show as agreements
agreements()
```

###  Baselines Comparison LineView

This visualizer provides a GUI to compare the goldstandard process element annotations and the Baseline 1 ones.

```python
from Visualizers.BaselinesComparisonLineView import Show as lineview
lineview()
```

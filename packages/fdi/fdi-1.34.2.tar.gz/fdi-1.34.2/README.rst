Flexible Dataset Integrator (FDI) helps data producers and processors to build connections into isolated heterogeneous datasets. to assemble, organize, and integrate data into self-describing, modular, hierarchical, persistent, referenceable ``Products``, whose component datasets keep their own characteristicss and are easily accessible.

FDI provides scripting-friendly  APIs  and 
tools to define custom Products and generating Python class files. An integrated Product takes care of inter-platform compatibility, string representation, serialisation to simple exchange format, persistence to disk or server, and carrying references of other Products, enabling context-building and lazy-loading.

FDI's base data model is defined in sub-package ``dataset``. Persistent data
access using storage pools, referencing, and Universal Resource Names, and referencie-carrying product Context, are defined in sub-package ``pal``. A reference RESTful API server designed to communicate with a data processing server/docker using the data model, and a reference HTTP pool server are in sub-package ``pns``.

.. tip::

   It is a good idea to add ``--user`` at the end or to use a virtualenv to avoid disturbing your system Python setup.

For Users
---------

If you need to use fdi, install from PyPI:

.. code-block:: shell

   python3 -m pip install fdi

or from git repo:

.. code-block:: shell

   python3 -m pip install http://mercury.bao.ac.cn:9006/mh/fdi/-/archive/master/fdi-master.tar.gz

If you want to install the ``develop`` dependencies:

.. code-block:: shell

   python3 -m pip install fdi[DEV]
   
or

.. code-block:: shell

   python3 -m pip install http://mercury.bao.ac.cn:9006/mh/fdi/-/archive/develop/fdi-develop.tar.gz#egg=fdi[DEV]


If you do not need to run tests, remove ``[DEV]`` to save time and disk space.

To uninstall:

.. code-block:: shell

           python3 -m pip uninstall fdi


For Developers  (or Those who are Not Sure which to Choose)
-----------------------------------------------------------

To install
''''''''''

.. code-block:: shell

           FDIINSTDIR=/tmp   # change this to your installation dir
           cd $FDIINSTDIR
           git clone http://mercury.bao.ac.cn:9006/mh/fdi.git
           cd fdi
	   git checkout develop
	   make install EXT="[DEV]"
	   
If you want to install the ``master`` branch, remove the ``git checkout develop`` line above.
	   
To test your installation
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

.. code-block:: shell

           make test

.. tip::

   To pass command-line arguments to ``pytest`` do, for example,
   
   .. code-block:: shell
		   
		make test T='-k Bas'

   to test ``BaseProduct``.


To Generate Python Product Source Code
--------------------------------------

Re-generate ``baseproduct.py`` and ``product.py`` from YAML schema files in
``fdi/dataset/resources``:

.. code-block:: shell

           make py

Learn/Try the HTTP Pool Server APIs
-----------------------------------

The APIs are documented in `fdi/httppool/schema/pools.yml` with OpenAPI 3. Run this to see and try out with Swagger API Docs when the server is running:

.. code-block:: shell

		http://127.0.0.1:5000/apidocs

Modify/Generate Documents
-------------------------

If you plan to compile documents in the ``docs`` directory, generate diagrams, API files, or HTML pages, run (in that order, respectively):

First run this once to install necessary packages:

.. code-block:: shell

           python3 -m pip install -U -e .[PUB]

Then when you need to make new class diagrams, API docs, or HTML pages:

.. code-block:: shell

           make docs_plots
           make docs_api
           make docs_html

The generated HTML page is at ``docs/html/index.html``.

.. note:: https://readthedocs.io makes web pages from sources in ``docs/sphinx`` in the repository. Locally generated HTML pages are not on RTD or in the repository. The API files and plots, however, are in ``api`` and ``_static`` sub-directpries, respectively.
	   
Run Servers and Quick Tests
---------------------------

If you plan to run the ``pns`` and/or the ``http pool server`` locally,
first install the dependencies:

.. code-block:: shell

           python3 -m pip install -e .[SERV]
	   make installpns

To test your ``pns`` servers installation, in one window, run:

.. code-block:: shell

           make runserver

in another window run:

.. code-block:: shell

           make testpns

To test your ``httppool`` servers installation, make sure to stop other server such as ``pnsserver`` above, then in one window, run:

.. code-block:: shell

           make runpoolserver

in another window run:

.. code-block:: shell

           make testhttp

Docker Containers
-----------------

fdi
'''

Get the ``fdi`` docker with running FDI environment:

.. code-block:: shell

   docker pull mhastro/fdi
   
or build the image locally:

.. code-block:: shell

   make build_docker

Launch and login

.. code-block:: shell

   make launch_docker
   make it

httppool
''''''''
   
Also available is a ``HttpPool`` server made from Ubuntu and apache:

.. code-block:: shell

   docker pull mhastro/httppool
   
To build the image locally:

.. code-block:: shell

   make build_server   
		
Launch and connect:

.. code-block:: shell

   make launch_server
   curl -i http://127.0.0.1:9884/v0.8/

Run the above in the package root directory of fdi. A file named ``.secret`` is needed by the build and launch commands. This is an example::

  PNS_PORT=9884
  PNS_USERNAME=...
  PNS__PASSWORD=...
  PNS_MQ_HOST=123.45.67.89
  PNS_MQ_PORT=9876
  PNS_MQ_USER=...
  PNS_MQ_PASS=...

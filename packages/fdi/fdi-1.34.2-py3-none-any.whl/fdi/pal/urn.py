    About_URN

The Universial Resource Name (**URN**, https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2141 ) string has this format:

        urn:<poolname>:<resourcetype>:<serialnumber>

with modified rules desribed below.

:<poolname>: Also called poolID. It consists of 1-32 characters, is case-sensitive, which deviates from rfc2141. Character allowed are ``alpha``, ``digit``, ``safe``, defined in rfc1630 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1630). These are excluded: `` ``, ``%``, ``?``, ``!``, ``*``,``'``, ``"``,  ``(``, ``)``, ``=``, ``/``, and what listed in ``mod:poolmanager:Invalid_Pool_Names``, e.g. ``pools``, ``urn``, ``URN``, ``api``.
:<resourcetype>: type name of the data item (usually class name of data products inheriting :class:`BaseProduct`)
:<serialnumber>: internal index for a certain <resourcetype>.

The ``poolname`` in a URN is a label. Some examples:

-  urn:pool_mh:fdi.dataset.product.Product:2
-  urn:20.20:svom.products.SVOMMapContext:0

URNs are used to to identify data be cause URNs are location agnostic. Storage Pools (subclasses of :class:`ProductPool`) are where data item reside. The **PoolURL** is used to give practical information of a pool, such as a poolname, its location, and its access scheme. PoolURL is designed to be a local set-up detail that is supposed to be hidden from pool users. Data processing software use ``URN``s to refer to products, without specifying pool location. The poolID in a URN could be a :class:`LocalPool` on the development laptop and a :class:`HTTPClientPool` on the production cloud.

    About_poolURL

The ``PoolURL`` format is in the form of a URL that preceeds its poolname part:

                 <scheme>://<place><poolpath>/<poolname>

:<scheme>: Implementation protocol including ``file`` for :class:`LocalPool`, ``mem`` for :class:`MemPool`, ``http``, ``https`` for :class:`HttpclientPool`.
:<place>: IP:port such as``192.168.5.6:8080`` for ``http`` and ``https`` schemes, or an empty string for ``file`` and ``mem`` schemes.
:<poolname>: In its simple form, the `poolname` is a string that has the same requirement as does the URN. One can put in another poolurl in the place of the `poolname` after replacing every '/' with ','.
:<poolpath>: The part between ``place`` and an optional ``poolhint``::
:<username>:
:<password>:

- For ``file`` or ``server`` schemes, e.g. poolpath is ``/c:/tmp`` in ``http://localhost:9000/c:/tmp/mypool/`` with ``poolhint`` keyword arguement of :func:`parse_poolurl` not given, or given as ``mypool`` (or ``myp`` or ``my`` ...).
- For ``http`` and ``https`` schemes, it is e.g. ``/0.6/tmp`` in ``https://10.0.0.114:5000/v0.6/tmp/mypool`` with ``poolhint`` keyword arguement not given, or given as ``mypool`` (or ``myp` or 'my' ...). The meaning of poolpath is subject to interpretation by the  server. In the preceeding example the poolpath has an API version.  :meth:`ProductPool.transformpath` is used to map it further. Note that trailing blank and ``/`` are ignored, and stripped in the output.

    Parameters
    ----------
    url : str
        to be decomposed.
    poolhint : str
        An optional URN (to extract poolname) or a pool URL (to be
    used for further connection, or usually, a simple poolname.
    The first distinctive substring is the poolname. If `poolhint`
    is not found, poolname is the default last fragment.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        poolpath, scheme, place, poolname, username, pasword.
        `(None, None,None,None)` if url is None or empty.

    Examples
    --------

    -  file:///tmp/mydata for pool ```mydata```
    -  file:///d:/data/test2--v2 for pool ``test2--v2``
    -  mem:///dummy for pool ``dummy``
    -  https://10.0.0.114:5000/v0.6/obs for a httpclientpool ``obs``
    -  server:///tmp/data/0.4/test for a pool ``test`` used on a server.
    -  csdb://127.0.0.1:9876/cc/v1/foo for a pool ``foo`` on a CSDB server running locally on port 9876.
    - http://127.0.0.1:5000/bar/csdb:,,10.0.0.114:9876,cc,v1,foo for a pool ``foo`` on a CSDB server running on 10.0.0.114:9876 with an HTTPPool interface server running locally. After registration with the poolurl,
`foo` can be accessed as http://127.0.0.1:5000/bar/foo

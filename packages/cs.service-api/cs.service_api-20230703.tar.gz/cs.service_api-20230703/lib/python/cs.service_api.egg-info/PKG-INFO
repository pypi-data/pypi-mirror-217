ServiceAPI, a base class for APIs which talk to a service,
typically a web service via HTTP.

*Latest release 20230703*:
Retry logic for requests.

An instance of a `ServiceAPI` embodies some basic features
that feel common to web based services:
- a notion of a login
- local state, an `SQLTags` for data about entities of the service
- downloads, if that is a thing, with `FSTags` for file annotations

## Class `HTTPServiceAPI(ServiceAPI, cs.resources.MultiOpenMixin, cs.context.ContextManagerMixin)`

`HTTPServiceAPI` base class for other APIs talking to HTTP services.

Subclasses must define:
* `API_BASE`: the base URL of API calls.
  For example, the `PlayOnAPI` defines this as `f'https://{API_HOSTNAME}/v3/'`.

## Class `RequestsNoAuth(requests.auth.AuthBase)`

This is a special purpose subclass of `requests.auth.AuthBase`
to apply no authorisation at all.
This is for services with their own special purpose authorisation
and avoids things like automatic netrc based auth.

## Class `ServiceAPI(cs.resources.MultiOpenMixin, cs.context.ContextManagerMixin)`

`SewrviceAPI` base class for other APIs talking to services.

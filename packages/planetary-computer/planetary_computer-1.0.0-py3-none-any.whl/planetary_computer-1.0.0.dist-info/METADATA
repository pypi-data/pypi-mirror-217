# Planetary Computer SDK for Python

Python library for interacting with the Microsoft Planetary Computer.

For general questions or discussions about the Planetary Computer, use the [microsoft/PlanetaryComputer](http://github.com/microsoft/PlanetaryComputer) repository.

## Installation

```python
pip install planetary-computer
```

If you have an API subscription key, you may provide it to the library by using the included configuration CLI:

```bash
planetarycomputer configure
```

Alternatively, a subscription key may be provided by specifying it in the `PC_SDK_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY` environment variable. A subcription key is not required for interacting with the service, however having one in place allows for less restricted rate limiting.


## Usage

This library assists with signing Azure Blob Storage URLs. The `sign` function operates directly on an HREF string, as well as several [PySTAC](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac) objects: `Asset`, `Item`, and `ItemCollection`. In addition, the `sign` function accepts a [STAC API Client](https://pystac-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) `ItemSearch`, which performs a search and returns the resulting `ItemCollection` with all assets signed.

### Automatic signing

If you're using pystac-client we recommend you use its feature to [automatically sign results](https://pystac-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#automatically-modifying-results) with ``planetary_computer.sign_inplace``:

```python
import planetary_computer
import pystac_client

from pystac_client import Client
import planetary_computer, requests
api = Client.open(
   'https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1',
   modifier=planetary_computer.sign_inplace,
)
```

Now all the results you get from that client will be signed.

### Manual signing

Alternatively, you can manually call ``planetary_computer.sign`` on your results.

```python
from pystac import Asset, Item, ItemCollection
from pystac_client import ItemSearch
import planetary_computer as pc


# The sign function may be called directly on the Item
raw_item: Item = ...
item: Item = pc.sign(raw_item)
# Now use the item however you want. All appropriate assets are signed for read access.

# The sign function also works with an Asset
raw_asset: Asset = raw_item.assets['SR_B4']
asset = pc.sign(raw_asset)

# The sign function also works with an HREF
raw_href: str = raw_asset.href
href = pc.sign(raw_href)

# The sign function also works with an ItemCollection
raw_item_collection = ItemCollection([raw_item])
item_collection = pc.sign(raw_item_collection)

# The sign function also accepts an ItemSearch, and signs the resulting ItemCollection
search = ItemSearch(
    url=...,
    bbox=...,
    collections=...,
    limit=...,
    max_items=...,
)
signed_item_collection = pc.sign(search)
```

### Convenience methods

You'll occasionally need to interact with the Blob Storage container directly, rather than
using STAC items. We include two convenience methods for this:

* `planetary_computer.get_container_client`: Get an [`azure.storage.blob.ContainerClient`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.containerclient?view=azure-python)
* `planetary_computer.get_adlfs_filesystem`: Get an [`adlfs.AzureBlobFilesystem`](https://github.com/fsspec/adlfs)

## Development

The following steps may be followed in order to develop locally:

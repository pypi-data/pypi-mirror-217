"""
This module contains classes for loading and collecting information from various file types.

It includes:

'Loader' - A generic class for loading files. Can be subclassed to create custom loaders for different file types.

'TiffLoader' - A class for working with TIFF image files. A subclass of Loader, it can be used to determine the data
type of the images, the number of frames in each TIFF file, and load frames from TIFF files.

Additional loaders can be created to work with other file types. See  Contributions for details.

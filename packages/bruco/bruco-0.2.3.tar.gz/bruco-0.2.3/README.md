## Explanation of parameters 

| Parameter | Explanation |
| ------ | ------ |
| `channel` | name of the target channel: BruCo with compute the coherence of this channels with all other available channels |
| `file`    | instead of specifying the channel with the argument above, you can provide the name of a ASCII or pickle file where the data can be read. If you use this option, the channel name specified with `--channel` is ignored, and the sampling frequency is inferred from the number of datapoints in the file and the GPS times |
| `target_source` | name of a text file containing a list of GWF files from where the target channel data is read. If not give, data is read with `gwpy` |
| `aux_source` | name of a text file containing a list of GWF files from where the auxiliary channels will be read. If not specified, `gw_data_find` is used to look for raw frame file |
| `ifo` | prefix determining the IFO, either 'H1' or 'L1' |
| `gpsb` | start GPS time of the data to analyze |
| `length` | duration of the data to be analyzed, in seconds |
| `outfs` | sampling frequency for all computations, meaning that coherence will be computed up to `outfs/2` |
| `naver` | number of desired averages for the periodogram-based computation of coherence. BruCo will approximate this number of averages by choosing a power-of-two FFT length that closely matches the desired number of averages |
| `fres` | an alternative way to specify the length of the FFTs, by giving the desired frequency resolution in Hz. BruCo will approximate this resolution by choosing a power-of-two FFT length |
| `dir` | all results and plots will be saved in this directory |
| `excluded` | name of a text file containing, in each row, the name of auxiliary channels to be excluded from the coherence computation, becuase they are known to have coherence with the target. Each row can be a unix-style wildcard |
| `minfs` | minimum sampling frequency of the auxiliary channels: all channels sampled at a lower frequency are excluded |
| `select` | a single unix-style wildcard to specify a subset of auxiliary channels to be analyzed |
| `modulations` | name of a text file where each row is the full name of a channel that will be used as a modulation witness. If specified, BruCo will compute the coherence of the target channel with each auxiliary channel, and with the product of each auxiliary channel with each of the modulation channels |
| `plot` | plot format. This can be `png` or `pdf` to produce static plots of the corresponding format, or `html` to produce interactive plots based on the `plotly` library |
| `calib` | name of a text file containing the calibration transfer function to be applied to the target channel spectrum, in a two column format (frequency, absolute value) |
| `aux_num_read` | maximum number of auxiliary channels to read simultaneously |
| `top` | save this many top-coherence channels for each frequency bin |
| `webtop` | include this many top-coherence channels in the final report |
| `xlim` | specify custom limits for the horizontal frequency axis |
| `ylim` | specify custom limits for the vertical amplitude spectral density axis |
| `nproc` | number of parallel processes to use. If not specified, use half of the available cores |

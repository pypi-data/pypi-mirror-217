`pop-loop` Contains plugins that allow alternate io loops to be used to run asynchronous code in pop projects.

About
=====

Pop used the asyncio loop by default in a built-in mod at 'hub.pop.loop'.
It became necessary to split the mod into it's own project for more loop capabilities.
For testing, loop management was difficult, but paired with pytest-pop, pop-loop makes async testing easy.


What is POP?
------------

This project is built with `pop <https://pop.readthedocs.io/>`__, a Python-based
implementation of *Plugin Oriented Programming (POP)*. POP seeks to bring
together concepts and wisdom from the history of computing in new ways to solve
modern computing problems.

Usage
=====

Describe some basic example use case for this plugin.

Examples
--------

uvloop example:
.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    import pop.hub

    hub = pop.hub.Hub()

    hub.pop.loop.create(loop_plugin="uv")
    task = hub.pop.Loop.create(asyncio.sleep(0))
    hub.pop.Loop.run_until_complete(task)


trio example:
.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    import pop.hub

    hub = pop.hub.Hub()

    hub.pop.loop.create(loop_plugin="trio")
    task = hub.pop.Loop.create(asyncio.sleep(0))
    hub.pop.Loop.run_until_complete(task)


QT example:
.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio
    import pop.hub
    import PyQt5.QtWidgets as pyqt5


    hub = pop.hub.Hub()
    hub.loop.qt.APP = pyqt5.QApplication([])
    hub.pop.loop.create(loop_plugin="qt")

    task = hub.pop.Loop.create(asyncio.sleep(0))
    hub.pop.Loop.run_until_complete(task)

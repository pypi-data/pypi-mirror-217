    "## A Conceptual Understanding of FastAPI with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome, students! In this section of the tutorial, we will explore the fundamental concepts behind FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python, using an engaging metaphor. This will help you grasp the essence of FastAPI without diving into code just yet. Let's begin!\n",
    "\n",
    "### FastAPI as a Restaurant\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that FastAPI is a popular restaurant, and Python is the skilled chef working behind the scenes. The restaurant (FastAPI) serves various dishes (API endpoints) to its customers (users), who place orders (send requests) through a waiter (the web server). The chef (Python) then prepares the dishes according to the recipes (your code) and sends them back to the customers through the waiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Menu: API Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "In a restaurant, the menu lists all the dishes available along with their descriptions and prices. Similarly, FastAPI uses an API schema to list all the available endpoints, their input parameters, and expected output. The schema also includes documentation to help users understand how to interact with the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI uses the OpenAPI standard for its schema, which is like a universal language for describing the menu. This means that users can easily discover and understand the available endpoints and their purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Waiter: ASGI Web Server\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that dishes are served quickly and efficiently, the restaurant needs a skilled waiter. In the context of FastAPI, the waiter is the ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) web server that handles communication between the users and the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ASGI web server, such as Uvicorn or Daphne, listens for incoming requests from users, forwards them to the FastAPI application, and then sends the responses back to the users. FastAPI's support for ASGI allows it to handle asynchronous tasks efficiently, resulting in better performance and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Chef: Python\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of any great restaurant is a talented chef who crafts delicious dishes. In our metaphor, Python is the chef who prepares the dishes (executes your code) according to the recipes (your functions and classes) that you've provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI is built on top of Python, leveraging its simplicity, readability, and vast ecosystem of libraries and packages. This makes it easy to write clean, maintainable code and integrate with various third-party components.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Recipes: Your Code\n",
    "\n",
    "As a developer, you define the recipes (your code) that the chef (Python) will use. Your code consists of functions and classes that describe how to process the requests and generate the appropriate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "With FastAPI, you can define your API endpoints using Python functions and decorators, which are like labels that give the restaurant specific instructions on how to handle each dish. FastAPI then uses these decorators to automatically generate the API schema, validate input data, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Kitchen: Dependency Injection\n",
    "\n",
    "A well-organized kitchen is essential for a smooth running restaurant. In FastAPI, the kitchen is represented by its dependency injection system. Dependency injection allows you to define reusable components, such as database connections, authentication systems, or any other shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "These components can then be \"injected\" into your endpoint functions as needed, making your code more modular and easy to maintain. It also helps with testing, as you can easily swap out components with mock implementations during testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wrapping Up\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding FastAPI as a restaurant, you can see how its various components work together to create a smooth, efficient, and satisfying experience for both developers and users. The menu (API schema), waiter (ASGI web server), chef (Python), recipes (your code), and kitchen (dependency injection) all contribute to FastAPI's powerful and flexible system for building APIs with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this conceptual foundation in place, you are well-equipped to dive into the more technical aspects of FastAPI and start building your own APIs. Enjoy your meal, and happy coding!"

    "# A Concrete Understanding of the Syntax of FastAPI with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore the syntax of FastAPI by breaking down an example. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of FastAPI's syntax and how to use it to create an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Creating a Basic API with FastAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by creating a simple API that receives a name as input and returns a greeting message. We'll analyze the code step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import FastAPI and create an instance\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a route for the root endpoint\n",
    "@app.get(\"/\")\n",
    "def read_root():\n",
    "    return {\"Hello\": \"World\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a route for the /greet/{name} endpoint\n",
    "@app.get(\"/greet/{name}\")\n",
    "def greet(name: str):\n",
    "    return {\"message\": f\"Hello, {name}\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing FastAPI and Creating an Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to import FastAPI from the `fastapi` package and create an instance of it. This will be the main instance that we'll use to define the API's routes and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining Routes\n",
    "\n",
    "Routes are the main components of an API. They define the different endpoints that the API will respond to. In FastAPI, we define routes by creating functions and decorating them with the appropriate route decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we have two routes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The root endpoint (\"/\") that returns a simple \"Hello, World\" message.\n",
    "2. The \"/greet/{name}\" endpoint that takes a name as input and returns a personalized greeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Root Endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "To define the root endpoint, we create a function called `read_root` and decorate it with the `@app.get(\"/\")` decorator. This tells FastAPI that this function should be called when the client sends a GET request to the root (\"/\") endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.get(\"/\")\n",
    "def read_root():\n",
    "    return {\"Hello\": \"World\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns a dictionary containing the greeting message. FastAPI will automatically convert this dictionary to a JSON object when sending the response to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Greet Endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "To define the \"/greet/{name}\" endpoint, we create a function called `greet`. The function takes a single argument, `name`, which is a string. We use the `@app.get(\"/greet/{name}\")` decorator to tell FastAPI that this function should be called when the client sends a GET request to the \"/greet/{name}\" endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.get(\"/greet/{name}\")\n",
    "def greet(name: str):\n",
    "    return {\"message\": f\"Hello, {name}\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns a dictionary containing a personalized greeting message. As with the root endpoint, FastAPI will automatically convert this dictionary to a JSON object when sending the response to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the FastAPI Server\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the FastAPI server, we need to use an ASGI server like `uvicorn`. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install uvicorn\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, save the example code in a file called `main.py`. Then, in your terminal, navigate to the folder containing `main.py` and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "uvicorn main:app --reload\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will start the FastAPI server on `http://localhost:8000/`. You can now test the API endpoints using your browser or a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we've analyzed the syntax of FastAPI by breaking down a simple example. We've learned how to import FastAPI, create an instance of it, define routes, and run the FastAPI server. With this knowledge, you can start building your own APIs using FastAPI and Python."

    "## A Concrete Understanding of How to Use FastAPI with Python to Solve Real-World Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will dive into some practical examples of how to use FastAPI with Python to solve real-world problems. We will cover the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Building a simple RESTful API using FastAPI\n",
    "2. Query Parameters and Path Parameters\n",
    "3. Request Body and Response Model\n",
    "4. Implementing CRUD Operations\n",
    "5. Adding Basic Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Building a Simple RESTful API using FastAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by building a simple RESTful API to manage a list of tasks. This will require creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, install FastAPI and Uvicorn, which will be our ASGI server:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install fastapi\n",
    "pip install uvicorn\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's create a file `main.py` and import FastAPI:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "\n",
    "tasks = []\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.get(\"/tasks\")\n",
    "def read_tasks():\n",
    "    return tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.get(\"/tasks/{task_id}\")\n",
    "def read_task(task_id: int):\n",
    "    return tasks[task_id]\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.post(\"/tasks\")\n",
    "def create_task(task: str):\n",
    "    tasks.append(task)\n",
    "    return {\"task\": task, \"id\": len(tasks) - 1}\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.put(\"/tasks/{task_id}\")\n",
    "def update_task(task_id: int, new_task: str):\n",
    "    tasks[task_id] = new_task\n",
    "    return {\"task\": new_task, \"id\": task_id}\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.delete(\"/tasks/{task_id}\")\n",
    "def delete_task(task_id: int):\n",
    "    tasks.pop(task_id)\n",
    "    return {\"result\": \"Task deleted\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the server, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uvicorn main:app --reload\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now access the API at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Query Parameters and Path Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI provides an easy way to work with query parameters and path parameters. In the previous example, we used path parameters to identify specific tasks. Now, let's add query parameters to filter our tasks based on a search keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.get(\"/tasks\")\n",
    "def read_tasks(search: str = None):\n",
    "    if search:\n",
    "        return [task for task in tasks if search in task]\n",
    "    return tasks\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can filter tasks by adding a `search` query parameter to the `/tasks` endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Request Body and Response Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using plain strings for tasks, let's create a more structured representation using Pydantic models. This allows us to define the request body and response model for our endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, install Pydantic:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pydantic\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's update the code to use Pydantic models:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pydantic import BaseModel\n",
    "\n",
    "class Task(BaseModel):\n",
    "    id: int\n",
    "    title: str\n",
    "    description: str\n",
    "    completed: bool = False\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.post(\"/tasks\", response_model=Task)\n",
    "def create_task(task: Task):\n",
    "    tasks.append(task)\n",
    "    return task\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.put(\"/tasks/{task_id}\", response_model=Task)\n",
    "def update_task(task_id: int, updated_task: Task):\n",
    "    tasks[task_id] = updated_task\n",
    "    updated_task.id = task_id\n",
    "    return updated_task\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Implementing CRUD Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already implemented basic CRUD operations in our previous examples. You can further extend these operations to handle more complex scenarios, such as handling errors or validating input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Adding Basic Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "To add basic authentication to our API, we can use the `HTTPBasic` class from FastAPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, install the required packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install python-multipart\n",
    "pip install passlib[bcrypt]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's update the code to include basic authentication:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException\n",
    "from fastapi.security import HTTPBasic, HTTPBasicCredentials\n",
    "from passlib.context import CryptContext\n",
    "\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "\n",
    "security = HTTPBasic()\n",
    "pwd_context = CryptContext(schemes=[\"bcrypt\"], deprecated=\"auto\")\n",
    "\n",
    "users = {\n",
    "    \"user1\": {\n",
    "        \"username\": \"user1\",\n",
    "        \"hashed_password\": pwd_context.hash(\"password1\"),\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "def authenticate(credentials: HTTPBasicCredentials = Depends(security)):\n",
    "    user = users.get(credentials.username)\n",
    "    if not user or not pwd_context.verify(credentials.password, user[\"hashed_password\"]):\n",
    "        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail=\"Invalid credentials\")\n",
    "    return user\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.get(\"/tasks\")\n",
    "def read_tasks(user: dict = Depends(authenticate)):\n",
    "    return tasks\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the `/tasks` endpoint will require valid credentials to access the list of tasks.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Problem: Creating a Simple Library Management API using FastAPI**\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first-year computer science student, you are tasked with developing a simple Library Management API using FastAPI and Python. This API will allow users to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on a collection of books in a library.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a Book model with the following attributes:\n",
    "   - id: integer (unique identifier for each book)\n",
    "   - title: string (title of the book)\n",
    "   - author: string (author of the book)\n",
    "   - publication_year: integer (year the book was published)\n",
    "   - available: boolean (whether the book is available for borrowing or not)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implement the FastAPI application with the following endpoints:\n",
    "   - `/books` (GET): Retrieve a list of all books in the library.\n",
    "   - `/books` (POST): Add a new book to the library.\n",
    "   - `/books/{id}` (GET): Retrieve the details of a specific book by its id.\n",
    "   - `/books/{id}` (PUT): Update the details of a specific book by its id. (e.g., change the availability status)\n",
    "   - `/books/{id}` (DELETE): Remove a specific book from the library by its id.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use an in-memory data structure (e.g., a list or dictionary) to store the book data. You do not need to implement a database for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can use the FastAPI documentation as a reference: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com\n",
    "- Don't worry about authentication or authorization for this problem."

# Ô∏èü§ñ‚öôÔ∏è Rift Code Engine

An AI-first language server for powering your personal, on-device AI software engineer. Built and maintained by [Morph](https://morph.so).

## Development

Make sure you have `hatch` installed: `pipx install hatch`.
Similarly to `poetry`, `hatch` manages the versions of all the packages, reducing hassle with environments.

## Running

Get a development server running with `hatch run dev`. This will listen for LSP connections on port 7797.

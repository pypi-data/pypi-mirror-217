# Element data (WIP)
The data in this folder is a collection of properties of the elements of the periodic table

`element_group.json` is a JSON file which contains the metallic classification of all 118 elements i.e. whether an element is a transition metal, post-transition metal, chalcogen, noble gas etc. For elements with atomic numbers above 103, the metallic classification has been estimated based of the element's position in the periodic table

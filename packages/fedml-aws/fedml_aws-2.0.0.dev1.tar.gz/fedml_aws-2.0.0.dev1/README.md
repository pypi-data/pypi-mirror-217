# **DwcSagemaker class**

DwcSagemaker class initializes the resources required for the model training, and provides methods that enable the training data to be read from SAP SAP Datasphere and trains a Machine Learning model on Amazon Sagemaker.

## **Prerequisites**
- `sagemaker>=2`

To update `sagemaker` module, run the following code:

`!pip install --upgrade "sagemaker>=2"`

## **Constructor**

`DwcSagemaker(prefix='model-data', bucket_name=None)`

Initializes AWS specific resources for training such as role, region and bucket name.

If you are using DwcSagemaker on your local machine for predicting an AWS Sagemaker endpoint, please install boto3 and awscli before. `pip install boto3` and follow this documentation to download awscli: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

### **Parameters**:

`prefix` [(str)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) (optional):  
 Prefix for the S3 bucket for temporary storage of training data. Defaults to 'model-data'.      

 `bucket_name` [(str)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) (optional):  
 Name of the S3 bucket for temporary storage of training data. Defaults to None.  If not specified, a default bucket is created for each training job based on the current timestamp.

## **Training a scikit-learn model on Sagemaker**

**`train_sklearn_model(train_data=None, test_data=None, content_type=None, train_script=None, source_dir=None, instance_count=1, instance_type=None, base_job_name=None, hyperparameters=None, wait=False, logs='All', download_output=False)`**

### **Parameters**:

**`train_data` [(pandas.DataFrame)](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) or [(str)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str):**

Training data. This can be one of two types:

- [(str)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) A file:// path in local mode. Accepted file formats are `.csv, .json, .json.gz, .txt`.

**`test_data` [(pandas.DataFrame)](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) or [(str)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str):**

Test data. This can be one of two types:

- [(pandas.DataFrame)](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) Test data stored in a pandas dataframe.

- [(str)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) A file:// path in local mode. Accepted file formats are `.csv, .json, .json.gz, .txt`.

MIME type of the input data. Defaults to None. 

**`train_script` [(str)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str):**

Path (absolute or relative) to the Python source file which should be executed as the entry point to training.

**`source_dir` [(str)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str):**

Path (absolute, relative or an S3 URI) to a directory with any other training source code dependencies aside from the train_script file. If specified, then train_script must point to a file located at the root of source_dir.

**`instance_count` [(int)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int) (optional):**

Number of Amazon EC2 instances to use for training. Defaults to 1.

Hyperparameters that will be used for training. Defaults to None. The hyperparameters are made accessible as a dict[str, str] to the training code on SageMaker. For convenience, this accepts other types for keys and values, but `str()` will be called to convert them before training.

**`wait` [(bool)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool) (optional):**

Whether the call should wait until the job completes. Defaults to True.

**`logs` [(str)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) (optional):**

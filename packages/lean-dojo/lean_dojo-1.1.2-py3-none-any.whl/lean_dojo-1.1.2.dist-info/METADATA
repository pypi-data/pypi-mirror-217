LeanDojo: Machine Learning for Theorem Proving in Lean
======================================================

![LeanDojo](https://github.com/lean-dojo/LeanDojo/blob/main/images/LeanDojo.jpg)

[LeanDojo](https://leandojo.org/) is a Python library for learningâ€“based theorem provers in Lean, supporting both [Lean 3](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean) and [Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/). It provides two main features:

* Extracting data (proof states, tactics, premises, etc.) from Lean repos.
* Interacting with Lean programmatically.

______________________________________________________________________

## Requirements

* Supported platforms: Linux, Windows (WSL), and macOS (:warning: experimental for Apple silicon)
* Git >= 2.25
* 3.9 <= Python <= 3.10
* wget
* Docker strongly recommended


## Installation

LeanDojo is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lean-dojo/) and can be installed via pip:
```bash
pip install lean-dojo
```

It can also be installed locally from the Git repo:
```bash
pip install .
```

:warning: **Known issue**: If you encounter errors related to `ray` and `pydantic`, see this temporary workaround: https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/37019. The error will be fixed when Ray 2.6 is released.

# **Raspberry Pi controller**
## Feature

 1. Connect in ssh to the Raspberry Pi
 2.  Module and Global call are supported
 3. The function can be run on the Raspberry Pi  by calling `@raspberry_control.raspberry_command()` and get the result
 4. Get Output of a function that was run on the raspberry
 5. Real-time output
 6. Run command on the Raspberry Pi with `raspberry_control.run_command("command here")`
 7. You can do `@raspberrypi.timeout(time,default)` that will make the function stop after the time specified and stop if it's not finish
## Example

    import raspberrypi_control # import package for raspberrypi controlling over ssh  
    import os # Put import here they are take and install to the raspberrypi file.  
    import time  
      
    rp = raspberrypi_control # rp is for RaspBerryPi  
      
    i = 1234567890  
      
      
    @rp.raspberry_command() # run code and you're raspberrypi. If the raspberrypi was not find it's will be run in local.  
    def test():  
        print("Hello RaspBerryPi")  
        return "finished"  
      
      
    @rp.raspberry_command() # run code and you're raspberrypi. If the raspberrypi was not find it's will be run in local  
    def other():  
        global i  
        print("Hello RaspBerryPi h")  
        th = 0  
        print(i)  
        os.system("echo Hello World")  
        while True:  
            th = th + 1  
            if th == 30:  
                time.sleep(0.1)  
                break  
        return th  
      
      
    if __name__ == "__main__": # put all you're code to run at start here. Because if not the code will be run 2 time  
        rp.raspberrypi().set_preparation("192.168.0.10", 8, 1) # config locator for the raspberrypi  
        rp.raspberrypi().local("192.168.0.10") # set the start ip set in the line in the top  
        rp.config("main") # file name if this file (no .py)  
        print(test())  
        print(other()) # you can get the output after

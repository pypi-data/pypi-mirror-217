5.17 USD
```

Python library providing effortless unit handling and currency conversion for scientific and engineering purposes.

**misura** is a powerful Python library designed to facilitate the efficient handling of units of measure for scientific and engineering applications, including currencies handling and conversion with constantly updated exchange rates. With its unified interface for dealing with different units and their conversions, you can quickly and accurately complete calculations without the need for complex manual conversions. Additionally, **misura** supports uncertainty handling allowing you to work with physical quantities and their associated uncertainties in a user-friendly and intuitive fashion. What's more, **misura** grants you the flexibility to create custom units of measure, so you can work in your preferred units.

Make sure to take a look at the [documentation](https://misura.diantonioandrea.com), at the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/diantonioandrea/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and at the [examples](#examples).

### Importing misura

**misura** can be imported by:

```
import misura
```

## Examples

These are some examples of operations between quantities.  
Note that, by enabling `globals.style.unitHighlighting`, **misura** uses colorama to highlight units of measure. by disabling it, the output is in the form of `num [unit]`

### Mathematical operations

```python
from misura.quantities import quantity

num1 = quantity(2, "m s-1")
num2 = quantity(4, "m s-1")
num3 = quantity(2, "s", .5)

print(num1 + num2)
print((num1 + num2).dimension())
print(num1 * num2)
print(num1 / num3)
print(num3 ** 2)
```

The output is:

```
6 m / s
[length / time]
8 m(2) / s(2)
1.0 ± 0.25 m / s(2)
4 ± 2.0 s(2)
```

### Currencies

```python
from misura.currencies import currency

cur1 = currency(2, "EUR")
cur2 = currency(3, "USD")

print(cur0 * 2)
print(cur1 + cur0)
```

The output is:

```
4 EUR
5.17 USD
```

### Working with other libraries

```python
from misura.quantities import quantity, convert
from decimal import Decimal, getcontext
import numpy

getcontext().prec = 40

arr1 = numpy.array([quantity(2, "m"), quantity(50, "m s-1"), quantity(2, "kg")])
arr2 = quantity(numpy.array([1, 2, 3]), "J")
num2 = quantity(numpy.sqrt(Decimal(5)), "kg")

print(arr1 * 3)
print(arr2 ** 2)
print(num2)
```

The output is:

```
[6 m 150 m / s 6 kg]
[1 4 9] J(2)
2.236067977499789696409173668731276235441 kg
```

Unit highlighting helps distinguish between different numbers.

### User defined units of measure

```python
from misura.quantities import quantity, convert
from misura.tables import addUnit

addUnit("volume", {"L": 1, "daL": 10, "hL": 100, "kL": 1000, "dL": 0.1, "cL": 0.01, "mL": 0.001}, "dm3")

num1 = quantity(3, "L")

print(convert(num1, "cm3"))
```

The output is:

```
3000.0 cm(3)
```

### Manual and automatic conversion

```python
from misura.quantities import quantity, convert

num1 = quantity(2, "m2")
num2 = quantity(4, "kg")
num3 = quantity(400, "m s-1")

print(convert(num1, "cm2"))
print(num2 + quantity(5, "g"))
print(convert(num3, "km", partial=True))
```

The output is:

```
20000.0 cm(2)
4.005 kg
0.4 km / s
```

### Unpack derived quantities

```python
from misura.quantities import quantity, unpack

num1 = quantity(2, "J2")
num2 = quantity(4, "C H")

print(unpack(num1))
print(unpack(num2, "H"))
```

The output is:

```
2.0 kg(2) m(4) / s(4)
4.0 C kg m(2) / A(2) s(2)
```

### Pack derived quantities

```python
from misura.quantities import quantity, pack

num1 = quantity(3, "N m T")
num2 = quantity(45, "A2 s2")

print(pack(num1, "J", ignore="T"))
print(pack(num2, "C", full=True))
```

The output is:

```
3.0 J T
45.0 C(2)
```

### Comparisons

```python
from misura.quantities import quantity

num1 = quantity(2, "m s-1")
num2 = quantity(4, "m s-1")
num3 = quantity(2, "s")

print(num1 > num2)
print(num2 < 6)
print(num1 > num3)
```

The output is:

```
False
True

misura.conversion.ConversionError: cannot convert from 's' to 'm s-1'
raised by: '2 s' -> 'm s-1'
```

### Unary operators and functions

```python
from misura.quantities import quantity
from misura.globals import style
from math import trunc

style.quantityHighlighting = False

num1 = quantity(2, "m s-1")
num2 = quantity(4.5, "m s-1")
num3 = quantity(-2, "s")

print(-num1)
print(trunc(num2))
print(abs(num3))
```

The output is:

```
-2 [m / s]
4 [m / s]
2 [s]
```

### Formatting

```python
from misura.quantities import quantity

num1 = quantity(2000, "m s-1")

print("Exponential notation: {:.2e}".format(num1))
```

The output is:

```
Exponential notation: 2.00e+00 m / s
```

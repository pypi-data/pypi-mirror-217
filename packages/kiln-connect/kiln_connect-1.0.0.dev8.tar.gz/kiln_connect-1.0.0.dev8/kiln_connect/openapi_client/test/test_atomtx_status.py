    Kiln API

    This API provides reporting staking data on various protocols as well as network wide data, staking transaction crafting features and so on.  ### ACCESS  In order to use the Kiln API, you must first get an API token from your <a href=\"https://dashboard.kiln.fi/\">Kiln dashboard</a> (applications section). If you don't have access to our dashboard, please get in touch at hello@kiln.fi.  Once you have your API token, you can set it as a bearer token in your HTTP request headers, and target the Kiln API endpoint with the current MAJOR version of the API as a prefix to routes:  <blockquote> curl \"https://api.kiln.fi/v1/...\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer $KILN_API_TOKEN\" </blockquote>  <i> If you need a development environment, please reach out to hello@kiln.fi to have a specific access to our testnet environment and dedicated API endpoint. </i>  ### CHANGELOG  <details> <summary>Preview (experimental & candidate changes for Kiln API 1.2.0) <a

is major   incompatible API changes, major versions will be communicated in   advance to all customers with a smooth transition path that   spans over a minimum period of 3 MINOR versions or ~3   months. <i>Intended frequency: 1 year</i>. - <b>MINOR</b> version is increased for backward compatible API   changes without notice, or communicated breaking changes with a   1 minor version notice and a smooth migration path. Minor   versions will be communicated regularly to customers with the   changelog. <i>Intended frequency: 1 month</i>. - <b>PATCH</b> version is increased for backward compatible   hot-fixes, patch versions will be communicated to affected   customers.  <i> Due to the nature of blockchains (protocol disappearing, breaking protocol upgrades), Kiln may introduce backward-incompatible changes in MINOR versions after following a 1 MINOR version deprecation path (~1 month). These impacting changes will be narrowed as much as possible to the protocol, heavily communicated with clear guidelines and support. Customer not relying on affected protocols will not be affected. </i>  ### BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY  Kiln considers the following changes to be backward compatible:  - Adding new API routes. - Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods. - Adding new properties to existing API responses. - Changing the order of properties in existing API responses. - Adding new event types in existing enums.  Non-breaking changes may be introduced in our API and subject to modification before being officialy communicated and documented here. Your application should not depend on them until part of this specification. The preview Kiln API specifications with upcoming and experimental new features can be found [here](/preview.html).  # noqa: E501

# medkit

medkit is a toolkit for a learning health system, developed by the [HeKA research team](https://team.inria.fr/heka).

This python library aims at:
* (1) facilitating the manipulation of healthcare data of various modalities (e.g., structured, text, audio data) for the extraction of relevant features and
* (2) developing supervised models from these various modalities for decision support in healthcare. 

## Getting started

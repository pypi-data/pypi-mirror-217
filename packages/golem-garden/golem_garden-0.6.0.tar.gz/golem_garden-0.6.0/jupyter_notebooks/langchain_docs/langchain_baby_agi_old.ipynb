    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi/tree/main) by [Yohei Nakajima](https://twitter.com/yoheinakajima). BabyAGI is an AI agent that can generate and pretend to execute tasks based on a given objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will help you understand the components to create your own recursive agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although BabyAGI uses specific vectorstores/model providers (Pinecone, OpenAI), one of the benefits of implementing it with LangChain is that you can easily swap those out for different options. In this implementation we use a FAISS vectorstore (because it runs locally and is free)."

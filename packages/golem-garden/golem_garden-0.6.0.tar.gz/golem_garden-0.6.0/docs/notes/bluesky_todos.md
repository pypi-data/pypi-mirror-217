- Intermediary toml format to spin up golems
  - may need a parser script (factory?) that's aware of things like which tools are available, etc
  - goal is a clean, human-readable toml that makes this data-driven. new visualizations can emerge from there. 
- Code and markdown snipping / saving tools. 
- new tool for basic File I/O (unless already exists)

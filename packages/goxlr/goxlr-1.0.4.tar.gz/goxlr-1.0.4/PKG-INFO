# GoXLR Utility API Python Wrapper

A python wrapper for the API of the open-source GoXLR software alternative, GoXLR Utility, that uses asyncio.

## Features
- Asynchronous connection to the GoXLR utility daemon
- Almost all methods have been translated to Python
- Handy enumerators for everything
- Very simple and easy to get started

## Installation
```shell
pip install goxlr
```

## Getting Started
Here's some sample code to get started with this package that pings the utility's daemon.
```py
import asyncio
from goxlr import GoXLR

async def main():
    async with GoXLR() as xlr:
        print(await xlr.ping())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
You may have noticed that we use `with` to manage the connection to the GoXLR. You may also wish to use the more traditional open and close methods which is acceptable too.
```py
async def main():
    xlr = GoXLR()
    xlr.connect()
    print(await xlr.ping())
    xlr.close()
```

## Documentation
Coming soon. For now, please refer to [goxlr.py](https://github.com/samcarsonx/goxlr/blob/main/goxlr/goxlr.py) to see all of the daemon and GoXLR commands, and refer to [types.py](https://github.com/samcarsonx/goxlr/blob/main/goxlr/types.py) to see all of the enums. You may find it very useful to have an IntelliSense-style plugin in your IDE.

## Contributing
Coming soon. As there isn't a CONTRIBUTING.md yet, please try to emulate the style of the rest of the code. Using snake_case and descriptive method argument names with type hints wherever possible.

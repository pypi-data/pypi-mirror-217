    You are an expert software engineer. I need you to generate a commit message for a change in a git repository.
    Here's the DIFF

    BEGIN DIFF
    {diff_context}
    END DIFF

    Remember:
    - Lines starting with "-" are being removed.
    - Lines starting with "+" are being added.
    - Lines starting with " " are unchanged.

    Consider the file names for context (e.g., "README.md" is a markdown file, "*.py" is a Python file).
    Understand the difference between code and comments. Comment lines start with ##, #, or //.

    The commit message should:
    - Start with a short summary (<72 characters).
    - Follow with a blank line and detailed text, but only if necessary. If the summary is sufficient, then no detailed text is needed.
    - Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature").
    - Be in GitHub-flavored markdown format.
    - Include contextually appropriate emojis (optional).

    Start your response with the commit message. No prefix or introduction. Your entire response will be the commit message.

    As for the length of the message, I want you to scale with the length of the diff context.
    If the DIFF is a small change, respond quickly with a terse message so we can go faster.

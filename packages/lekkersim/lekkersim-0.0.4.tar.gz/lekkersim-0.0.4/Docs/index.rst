LekkerSIM: Photonic circuits linear simulator
==================================================================

LekkerSIM is a open source package for linear simulation of photonic circuit, based on the well known scattering matrix method.
It features include:
    - Easy calculation of S-parameters of a photonic circuit;
    - A collection of pre-defined building blocks for easy definition of circuits;
    - Parametric building blocks;
    - Hierarchical circuit definition;
    - Monitors inside the circuit for calculation of power flow.

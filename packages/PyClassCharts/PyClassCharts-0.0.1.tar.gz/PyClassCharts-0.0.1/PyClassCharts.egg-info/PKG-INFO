# PyClassCharts
 An UNOFFICIAL wrapper made in python for the ClassCharts API. 

Inspired by [NCPlayz's Wrapper](https://github.com/NCPlayz/classcharts.py). 

Currently this is a work in progress project and will only be worked on as needed to add new features or to fix broken things since it's just made for a few simple tasks.

# hegel

Welcome to `hegel`, the python client library for [Hegel AI](https://hegel-ai.com/).
This library adds the full functionality of our Dialectic product to your LLM,
including observability, computing metrics, and tracking customer feedback.

## Monitoring your LLM

To use `hegel`, you'll wrap your current call to an LLM API with the `HegelScribe` object.
`HegelScribe` helps record the input and response of a LLM call with
minimal overhead. The call to the LLM's API is not routed through our server;
only the input and response are captured and written to the database
through a separate thread without blocking the main thread.

```python
import openai
from hegel.scribe import HegelScribe

scribe = HegelScribe(completion_fn=openai.ChatCompletion.create)
response = scribe(
    model= "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages = [  
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
    ])
```

### Setting your API key
An OpenAI API key is needed if you would like to use OpenAI's API (we do not store or track your API key in anyway).
A separate Hegel API key is needed to use our service. You can get a key by [contacting us](mailto:team@hegel-ai.com). 

To set your API keys:
```bash
# Starting from this `hegel` directory
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to include your keys. Avoid sharing that file.


### Viewing Logs and Metrics

Scribe collects metrics, monitors failures, and helps gather customer feedback. 
You can view aggregate metrics, drill into logs, and more on the [Hegel Dashboard](https://app.hegel-ai.com/).

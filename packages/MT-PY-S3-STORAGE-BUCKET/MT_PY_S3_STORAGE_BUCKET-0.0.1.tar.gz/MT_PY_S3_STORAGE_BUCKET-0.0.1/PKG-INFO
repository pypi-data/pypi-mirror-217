At the moment, our code is capable of storing the files in the database. However, this is not a desirable practice. With time our database will get "fat" and slow, and we do not want that to happen. Images haven't been stored in databases as blobs for a while now, and you'll typically save images on your own server where the application is hosted on, or on an external server or service such as AWS's S3.

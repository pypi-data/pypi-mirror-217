## Acknowledgements

[PDM](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm) and [MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs) made my `nagata` development workflow better and easier. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to [pawamoy](https://github.com/pawamoy) whose excellent PDM and Mkdocs extensions and utlities are incorporated into `nagata`. The scripts, documentation, configuration files, and other CI code were all adapted (or simply copied) from pawamoy's repositories.

I would also like to thank the University of Kansas School of Law for tolerating and supporting this law professor's coding efforts, an endeavor which is well outside the typical scholarly activities in the discipline.

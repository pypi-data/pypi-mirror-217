# Unreal Engine Assets Dump

Command-line Interface (CLI) responsible for returning the list of the assets of an Unreal Engine project into a JSON structure.

## Development

### Poetry

_Unreal Engine Assets Dump_ project used Poetry to declare all its dependencies.  [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is a python dependency management tool to manage dependencies, packages, and libraries in your python project.

We need to create the Python virtual environment using Poetry:

```shell
poetry env use /Users/Shared/Epic\ Games/UE_5.2/Engine/Binaries/ThirdParty/Python3/Mac/bin/python3
```

We can enter this virtual environment and install all the required dependencies:

```shell
poetry shell
poetry update
```


## Publication

To publish a new version of the _Unreal Engine Assets Dump_ library to [Pypi](https://pypi.org/), we need to execute the following command:

```shell
poetry publish --build --username $PYPI_USERNAME --password $PYPI_PASSWORD
```

Where the environment variables:

- `$PYPI_USERNAME`: The value `__token__`
- `$PYPI_PASSWORD`: The [API token](https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/) used to authenticate when uploading packages to PyPI (e.g., `pypi-...`)

We generally defined a `.env` file and add these environment variables:

PYPI_USERNAME=__token__
PYPI_PASSWORD=pypi-(...)
```


## Installation

To install _Unreal Engine Assets Dump_ library to Unreal Engine, execute the following command.

```shell
/Users/Shared/Epic\ Games/UE_5.1/Engine/Binaries/ThirdParty/Python3/Mac/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade uasset-dump
/Users/Shared/Epic\ Games/UE_5.2/Engine/Binaries/ThirdParty/Python3/Mac/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade uasset-dump
```

/Users/admin/Library/JenkinsAgent/workspace/client-app/scooby-app-build/main/Scooby/Content

## Execution

Then we can load our Unreal Engine project in Unreal Engine Editor and execute the following Python instructions in the Output Log drawer:

```shell
from bootloader.ue.utils import uasset_dump
uasset_dump.dump_assets('/Users/dcaune/Devel/Bootloader/bootloader-human-trainer-ar5/Content')
```

This prints long JSON data.  For instance:

```json
[
  {
    "asset_name": "A_d2_ChangeOutfit_01",
    "asset_class_path": "/Script/Engine/AnimSequence",
    "package_name": "/Game/ArtAssets/Pets/QuadrupedDog/Animations/A_d2_ChangeOutfit_01",
    "dependencies": [
      "/Game/ArtAssets/Pets/QuadrupedDog/Mesh/S_d2"
    ]
  },
  {
    "asset_name": "A_d2_ChangeOutfit_02",
    "asset_class_path": "/Script/Engine/AnimSequence",
    "package_name": "/Game/ArtAssets/Pets/QuadrupedDog/Animations/A_d2_ChangeOutfit_02",
    "dependencies": [
      "/Game/ArtAssets/Pets/QuadrupedDog/Mesh/S_d2"
    ]
  },
  (...)
]
```

```shell
export UNREAL_ENGINE_PROJECT_PATH=/Users/admin/Library/JenkinsAgent/workspace/client-app/scooby-app-build/main/Scooby/Scooby.uproject

export UNREAL_ENGINE_ASSET_DUMP_FILE_PATH=/Users/admin/bootloader-scooby-uassets.dump.json

"`find "/Users/Shared/Epic Games/UE_5.2" -name UnrealEditor-Cmd`" \
    "$UNREAL_ENGINE_PROJECT_PATH" \
    -run=pythonscript \
    -stdout \
    -Unattended \
    -script="/Users/admin/Downloads/run.py"

echo $?;
```

# Command Line Execution

```shell


```

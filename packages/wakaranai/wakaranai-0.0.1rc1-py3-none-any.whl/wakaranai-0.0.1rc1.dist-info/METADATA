Description-Content-Type: text/markdown

わからない (wakaranai) literally means "I don't understand" in Japanese.
It is a phrase worth learning, specially if you plan to visit Japan anytime soon.
If you'd like to learn more than just a couple of key phrases,
it might be useful to learn hiragana and katakana as well.
This Python package, called `wakaranai`, helps non-Japanese speakers
learn these two syllabaries by generating and applying random tests.

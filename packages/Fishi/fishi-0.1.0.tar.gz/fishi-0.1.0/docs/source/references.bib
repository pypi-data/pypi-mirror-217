  abstract = {The potential of mathematical models describing the microbial behavior during food processing and storage largely depends on their predictive capabilities and, in this concern, model calibration plays a crucial role. Unfortunately, model calibration may only be performed successfully if the sources of information are sufficiently rich. Therefore, a careful experimental design is required. This contribution formulated the optimal experimental design (OED) problem as a general dynamic optimization problem where the objective was to optimize a certain criterion depending on the Fisher information matrix. This formulation allows for more flexibility in the experimental design, including initial conditions, sampling times, experimental durations, time-dependent manipulable variables and number of experiments as degrees of freedom. Moreover, the use of robust confidence regions for the parameter estimates was suggested as an alternative to evaluate the quality of the proposed experimental schemes. The OED for the calibration of the thermal death time and Ratkowsky-type secondary models was considered for illustrative purposes, showing how the usually disregarded E-optimality criterion results in the experimental schemes offering the best compromise precision/decorrelation among the parameters. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS This work addresses a general methodology for designing optimal dynamic experiments for the purpose of model calibration. This methodology is general in the sense that it may be applied to any type of food processing model, being particularly relevant for predictive microbiology and quality assessment as the experimentation is both time consuming and expensive. The main advantages of the proposed technique are twofold: on one hand, it is able to significantly reduce the overall experimental burden, contributing not only to simplify the experimental planning, devising the most adequate experiments, but also minimizing the number of experiments, and on the other hand, the resultant experiments provide the maximum quantity and quality of information to improve the predictive capabilities of the models under consideration, of key importance for process design, optimization and control.}

  abstract = {The dynamic optimization (open loop optimal control) of non-linear bioprocesses is considered in this contribution. These processes can be described by sets of non-linear differential and algebraic equations (DAEs), usually subject to constraints in the state and control variables. A review of the available solution techniques for this class of problems is presented, highlighting the numerical difficulties arising from the non-linear, constrained and often discontinuous nature of these systems. In order to surmount these difficulties, we present several alternative stochastic and hybrid techniques based on the control vector parameterization (CVP) approach. The CVP approach is a direct method which transforms the original problem into a non-linear programming (NLP) problem, which must be solved by a suitable (efficient and robust) solver. In particular, a hybrid technique uses a first global optimization phase followed by a fast second phase based on a local deterministic method, so it can handle the nonconvexity of many of these NLPs. The efficiency and robustness of these techniques is illustrated by solving several challenging case studies regarding the optimal control of fed-batch bioreactors and other bioprocesses. In order to fairly evaluate their advantages, a careful and critical comparison with several other direct approaches is provided. The results indicate that the two-phase hybrid approach presents the best compromise between robustness and efficiency.},

In the past, major effort has been put into the modeling of microbial growth and inactivation within a constant environment (static models). In the early 1990s, differential equation models (dynamic models) were introduced in the field of predictive microbiology. Here, we present a general dynamic model-building concept describing microbial evolution under dynamic conditions. Starting from an elementary model building block, the model structure can be gradually complexified to incorporate increasing numbers of influencing factors. Based on two case studies, the fundamentals of both macroscopic (population) and microscopic (individual) modeling approaches are revisited. These illustrations deal with the modeling of (i) microbial lag under variable temperature conditions and (ii) interspecies microbial interactions mediated by lactic acid production (product inhibition). Current and future research trends should address the need for (i) more specific measurements at the cell and/or population level, (ii) measurements under dynamic conditions, and (iii) more comprehensive (mechanistically inspired) model structures. In the context of quantitative microbial risk assessment, complexity of the mathematical model must be kept under control. An important challenge for the future is determination of a satisfactory trade-off between predictive power and manageability of predictive microbiology models.}

To identify the model parameters, full factorial designs are often used, in spite of the high experimental burden and cost related to this method. In this work, the impact of the selected experimental scheme on the estimation of the parameters of the cardinal model describing the effect of temperature, pH and/or water activity has been evaluated. In a first step, identification of a simple model describing only the effect of temperature, pH or water activity was considered. The comparison of an equidistant design and a D-optimal (based) design showed that the latter, which is based on the model's sensitivity functions, yields more realistic parameter estimates than the typical equidistant design. By selecting the experimental levels based on the sensitivity functions, a more realistic description of the behavior around optimal conditions can be obtained. In the second step, focus was on the efficient and accurate estimation of the ten parameters of the extended cardinal model that describes the combined effect of temperature, pH and water activity on the microbial growth rate. Again, equidistant level selection is compared to a D-optimal (based) experimental design. In addition, a full factorial and a Latin-square approach are evaluated. From the simulation case studies presented, it can be stated that all parameters can be equally well defined from an equidistant design as from a D-optimal-based design. In addition, reducing the experimental load by constructing a Latin-square design does not hamper the parameter estimation procedure. This work confirms the observation of a previous study, i.e., for complex cases a Latin-square design is an attractive alternative for a full factorial design as it yields equally accurate and reliable parameter estimates while reducing the experimental workload.},

In this work we present a general methodology to derive predictive models of fish freshness under different storage conditions. The approach makes use of the theory of optimal experimental design, to maximize data information and in this way reduce the number of experiments. The resulting growth model for specific spoilage microorganisms in hake (Merluccius merluccius) is sufficiently informative to estimate quality sensory indexes under time-varying temperature profiles. In addition it incorporates quantitative information of the uncertainty induced by fish variability. The model has been employed to test the effect of factors such as fishing gear or evisceration, on fish spoilage and therefore fish quality. Results show no significant differences in terms of microbial growth between hake fished by long-line or bottom-set nets, within the implicit uncertainty of the model. Similar conclusions can be drawn for gutted and un-gutted hake along the experiment horizon. In addition, whenever there is the possibility to carry out the necessary experiments, this approach is sufficiently general to be used in other fish species and under different stress variables.},

Alternatively, robustness of the obtained solutions with respect to model uncertainties, e.g., guaranteeing that critical constraints are not violated, is of the highest importance in process industry. Moreover, robustness can also be interpreted as an additional and conflicting objective, since more robust solutions typically induce a performance decrease. The current manuscript exploits advanced deterministic techniques to efficiently and accurately generate Pareto sets in the presence of model uncertainty. The developed procedures allow the presentation of robust Pareto sets, i.e., Pareto sets in which robustness is an additional objective. Based on these Pareto sets, all trade-offs can clearly be assessed by the decision maker. Two illustrative case studies are presented for the optimal design and operation of a jacketed tubular reactor with conflicting conversion and energy objectives and a fed-batch bioreactor with conflicting productivity and yield aims.},

Over the years, different criteria have been developed. However, the important question that remains is which criterion to choose. In this work, an approach to tackle the criterion selection is presented. In addition, a multi-objective optimisation approach is implemented, which enables to combine two, often competing optimisation criteria. The developed approach is illustrated with two case studies.

  abstract = {Predictive microbiology emerges more and more as a rational quantitative framework for predicting and understanding microbial evolution in food products. During the mathematical modeling of microbial growth and/or inactivation, great, but not always efficient, effort is spent on the determination of the model parameters from experimental data. In order to optimize experimental conditions with respect to parameter estimation, experimental design has been extensively studied since the 1980s in the field of bioreactor engineering. The so-called methodology of optimal experimental design established in this research area enabled the reliable estimation of model parameters from data collected in well-designed fed-batch reactor experiments. In this paper, we introduce the optimal experimental design methodology for parameter estimation in the field of predictive microbiology. This study points out that optimal design of dynamic input signals is necessary to maximize the information content contained within the resulting experimental data. It is shown that from few dynamic experiments, more pertinent information can be extracted than from the classical static experiments. By introducing optimal experimental design into the field of predictive microbiology, a new promising frame for maximization of the information content of experimental data with respect to parameter estimation is provided. As a case study, the design of an optimal temperature profile for estimation of the parameters D(ref) and z of an Arrhenius-type model for the maximum inactivation rate kmax as a function of the temperature, T, was considered. Microbial inactivation by heating is described using the model of Geeraerd et al. (1999). The need for dynamic temperature profiles in experiments aimed at the simultaneous estimation of the model parameters from measurements of the microbial population density is clearly illustrated by analytical elaboration of the mathematical expressions involved on the one hand, and by numerical simulations on the other.},

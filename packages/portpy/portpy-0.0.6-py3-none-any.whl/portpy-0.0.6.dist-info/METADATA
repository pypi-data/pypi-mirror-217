# What is PortPy?
**Note: The package is at its early stages of development (version 0.0.1) and we are now collecting feedback from researchers to further refine the data structure and the main functionality. We are expecting to have a stable version 1.xx around July 2023. We would love to hear your feedback.**

PortPy (**P**lanning and **O**ptimization for **R**adiation **T**herapy) is a community effort to develop the **first opensource python library** to facilitate the development and clinical translation of radiotherapy cancer treatment planning algorithms. PortPy includes:
1. Research-ready data and code for *benchmarking*, *reproducibility*, and *community-driven* development.
2. Interface to an open-source optimization package [CVXPy](https://www.cvxpy.org/) for easy/quick prototyping and out-of-the-box access to commercial/opensource optimization engines (e.g., Mosek, Gorubi, CPLEX).
3. Visualization modules to visualize relevant plan information (e.g, dose volume histograms, dose distribution, fluence map).
4. Evaluation modules to quantify plan quality with respect to established clinical metrics (e.g., RTOG metrics, dose conformality, tumor control probability, normal tissue control probability).
# Data
Data needed for optimization and algorithm development (e.g., a set of beams/beamlets/voxels, dose contribution of each beamlet to each voxel) are provided for a set of pre-specified machine parameters (e.g., beam/collimator/couch angles). We will initially provide these for a set of publicly available datasets from [TCIA](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/). We initially start with two lung patients to get feedback and then expand to about 100 patients in version 1.xx (about end of July). We hope to further expand our dataset in the future. The data needed for optimization is extracted from Eclipse<sup>TM</sup>, a FDA-approved commerical treatment planning system ([Varian Medical Systems](https://www.varian.com/)), using its API. 

You can download the sample patient data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nA1oHEhlmh2Hk8an9e0Oi0ye6LRPREit?usp=sharing).

Create a directory named './data' in the current project directory and copy the downloaded file to it, e.g ./data/Lung_Phantom_Patient_1

# Quick Start
Please see below for understanding the basic functionalities of PortPy. For advance usage of PortPy, we recommend navigating through [examples](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/tree/master/examples) folder.
1. To understand the most important features of PortPy, we highly recommend going through notebook [ex_1_introduction.ipynb](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/ex_1_introduction.ipynb)
2. One of the major computational issues while optimizing the plan arise due to large size of influence matrix. We suggest you to follow [ex_2_down_sampling.py](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/ex_2_down_sampling.py) and [ex_4_inf_matrix_sparsification.py](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/ex_4_inf_matrix_sparsification.py) to understand how PortPy can assist in resolving it. 
3. You can check out [ex_3_structure_operations.py](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/ex_3_structure_operations.py) to know how to perform different structure operations (e.g., boolean, margin).
4. For algorithm benchmarking, the global optimal solution is provided for non-convex optimization problems resulting from beam angle optimization [ex_6_boo_benchmark.ipynb](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/ex_6_boo_benchmark.ipynb), incorporating DVH constraints [ex_5_dvh_benchmark.py](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/ex_5_dvh_benchmark.py), and VMAT optimization [ex_8_VMAT.py](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/ex_8_VMAT.py) using the mixed-integer programming on down-sampled data.
5. In addition to basic visualization capabilities, PortPy provide advanced visualization by integration with 3D Slicer. Please check out notebook [ex_7_Slicer.ipynb](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy/blob/master/examples/ex_7_Slicer.ipynb)

# Installing PortPy

1. Installing using pip
  ```bash
  pip install portpy
  ```
2. Installing using conda
  ```bash
  conda install -c conda-forge portpy
  ```
3. Installing from source
- Clone this repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy.git
  cd portpy
  ```

- You need to install the dependencies in either a python virtual environment or anaconda environment. Instructions for setting up in python virtual environment are as follows:

  Install all the dependencies present in requirements.txt:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  (venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

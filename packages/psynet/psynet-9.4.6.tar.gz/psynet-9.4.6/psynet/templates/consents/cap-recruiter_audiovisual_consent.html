    <h1>Research Participant Consent Form for Image/Sound Recordings</h1>

          <h2>Title of study: {{experiment_title}}</h2>
          <p>
              I have received oral and written information from Mr Harin Lee about the fact that <i>audiovisual</i> recordings will be made in this study.
          </p>
          <p>
              The recording serves the purpose of understanding how humans perceive and process information from sound and visual. For example, we would like to understand how predictive mechanisms in perception rely on experience, learning, and memory. By making recording people while moving, singing, tapping to rhythms, or speaking, we can infer the mechanisms of the auditory and visual systems.
          </p>
          <p>
              I have been informed that the storage and processing of the <i>audiovisual</i> recording will be carried out in pseudonymized form, i.e., using a number and without containing my name, and that there is a coding list that links my name to the number. The investigators are the only persons who have access to this coding list, which will be destroyed after completion of the research project. Researchers associated with this project will have access to my <i>audiovisual</i> data during the recording and the analysis of the material.
          </p>
          <p>
              I understand that I am free to withdraw my consent to the collection and storage of my personal data without negative consequences.
          </p>
          <p>
              I agree to the handling of the recordings as described above.
          </p>

          <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">Addendum for demonstrations.</span> I agree that my <i>audiovisual</i> recordings can be used for demonstration purposes in presentations with a limited number of participants (e.g., teaching courses or scientific presentations).
          </p>

              <input
                  type="checkbox"
                  id="demonstration-purposes-consent-yes"
                  class="demonstration-purposes-consent"
                  style="cursor: pointer;"/>
              <span>YES</span>

                  style="cursor: pointer;"/>
              <span>NO</span>
            </label>
  ​        </p>

          <p>
              The declaration of consent for <i>audiovisual</i> recordings is voluntary. I may withdraw my consent at any time. In case of refusal or withdrawal, no costs will be incurred nor will there be other negative consequences; however, in this case, participation in the study will not be possible.
          </p>

          <p>
              I had sufficient time for this decision. I have read and understood everything and hereby agree that <i>audiovisual</i> recordings of me may be taken. I have received a copy of this consent form.
          </p>

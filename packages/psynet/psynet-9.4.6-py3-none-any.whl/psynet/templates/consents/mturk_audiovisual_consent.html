                In this experiment, you may be asked to make a voice or video recording.
                For example, you may be asked to record your finger-tapping in response to
                a sound or video, or to record yourself speaking or singing.

          <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
          <p>
              All the recordings we obtain during this research will be kept confidential,
              and nobody outside the group of researchers will be able to share or store them.
              However, in some experiments, your recordings may be seen or heard by other
              participants in order to evaluate them in different attributes or create new
              materials (for example replicate a rhythm that you created, or continue a melody
              that you sang). Your recordings will not be associated with your name or other
              identifiers in any way. Your recordings will not be used to derive your real
              identity, and they will not be made public. Raw audio/video will not be shared
              with collaborators (we will only share extracted data from recordings without
              personal identifiers).
          </p>
          <p>
              Although researchers will not use your recordings to derive your real identity,
              personal information could be leaked if you are not in an isolated environment.
              You may wish to make sure that no sounds/visual material in your environment
              could be linked to your personal information. In addition, while you perform
              a recording, the microphone or camera can capture unintended audio or video,
              for example the camera can capture another family member, or the microphone
              can capture something you say to another person. If you choose to participate
              in the experiment, it is important and your responsibility to make sure that
              while you record audio and video nothing that you donâ€™t intend to be recorded
              is recorded. For example, you may want to sit in a room that is isolated from
              the rest of the house. By consenting to this experiment, you are committing
              not to use profanity while recording audio or nudity while recording video.
          </p>

          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>
              During data collection, audio-visual material will be recorded on a separate server and encrypted
              using a strong encryption protocol (such as Advanced Encryption Standard).
              MTurk ID information will not be used to index this data.
          </p>

          <h2>Consent</h2>
          <p>
              By consenting to participate, you acknowledge that you are 18 years or older,
              have read this consent form, agree to its contents, and agree to take part
              in this research. If you do not wish to consent, please close this page and
              return the HIT on Mechanical Turk.

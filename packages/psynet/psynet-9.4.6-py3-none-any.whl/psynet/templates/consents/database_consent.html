            <h4>PAYMENT AND COMPENSATION</h4>
            <p class="consent-text">
                We will not store any banking information or payment information in our system.  However we do store completion records and payment details of every task you completed. This information will be available for you to review it when you login to the database. Based on this information we allow you to receive payment via an external system such as PayPAL/WISE. It is your responsibility to make sure you can receive payment through this system and that you would want to consent to use it. This system supports transferring money to most banks around the world, please search your bank in their website to ensure that you will be able to receive payment prior to taking part in our experiments. We also recommend checking the term of service and it’s privacy statement and see if you consent to use their system for payment.

            <p class="consent-text">
                If you cannot or would not like to receive payment via this system, we would not be able to pay you, however you can still participate in our experiments voluntarily, without payment. In this case you will not receive any compensation for your time.

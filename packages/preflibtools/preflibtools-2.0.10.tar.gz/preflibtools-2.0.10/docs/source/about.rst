This new version of the PrefLib-Tools has been developped by `Simon Rey <https://reysimon.fr>`_. The original ones are
due to `Nicholas Mattei <https://https://www.nickmattei.net/>`_, who also provided guidance for the new version.

If you spot a mistake, want to suggest something or to contribute some code, use the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/PrefLib/preflibtools>`_.
We will be happy to have a look.

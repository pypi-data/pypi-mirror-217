# AlphaPeel

AlphaPeel is a software package for calling, phasing, and imputing genotype and sequence data in pedigree populations. This program implements single locus peeling, multi locus peeling, and hybrid peeling. A complete description of these methods is given in <a href="https://gsejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12711-018-0438-2">Hybrid peeling for fast and accurate calling, phasing, and imputation with sequence data of any coverage in pedigrees, Genetics Selection Evolution</a>.

## User guide

See `docs/source/index.rst` or PDF in the ZIP file in this repository.

## Conditions of use

AlphaPeel is part of a suite of software that our group has developed. It is fully and freely available for all use under the MIT License.

## Requirements

* Python 3
* NumPy
* Numba

## Installation

    wget https://github.com/AlphaGenes/AlphaPeel/raw/main/AlphaPeel.zip
    unzip AlphaPeel.zip
    pip install AlphaPeel/AlphaPeel*.whl

## Build instructions

Run the following to build the Python wheel and user guide. You will need an installation of [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) and [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/get) to build the user guide.

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/AlphaGenes/AlphaPeel.git
    cd AlphaPeel
    
    mamba create -n AlphaPeel
    mamba activate AlphaPeel
    mamba install python=3.9
    pip install sphinx
    ./build_pipeline.sh
    pip install --force-reinstall dist/AlphaPeel*.whl
    
    cd example; ./runScript.sh

The wheel can be found in `dist/` and PDF of the user guide at `docs/build/latex/alphaplantimpute2.pdf`

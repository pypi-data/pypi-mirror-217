        About MelCtl
        ============

        MelCtl provides a set of APIs to interact with LuxProvide_'s HPC (High
        Performance Computer) and Cloud services.

        The MelCtl command-line client allows our customers and internal users
        to interact with MelCtl APIs.

        The base package (`MelCtl client`_) provides basic plugins
        (e.g. authentication). Supplementary packages such as
        `melctl_client_plugins_customer` provides extra plugins to interact with
        more services from the command line.

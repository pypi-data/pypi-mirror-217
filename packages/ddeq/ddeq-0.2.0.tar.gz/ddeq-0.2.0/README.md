# Data-driven emission quantification

Algorithms for data-driven detection and quantification of hot spot emissions
in remote sensing observations.


## Installation
```
python -m pip install ddeq
```

## Tutorials
ddeq includes some tutorial using Jupyter Notebooks that show how the library
can be used to quantify CO2 and NOx emissions from cities and power plants. The
tutorials example data from the SMARTCARB dataset, the CoCO2 library of plumes
and the TROPOMI NO2 product.

You can find the tutorials in the "notebooks" folder.


## Examples
ddeq includes some examples using Jupyter Notebooks for specific applications
that can be found in the "notebooks" folder.

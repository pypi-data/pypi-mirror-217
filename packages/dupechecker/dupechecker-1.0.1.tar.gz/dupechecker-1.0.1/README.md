Check for and delete duplicate files from the command line.

## Installation

Install with:

<pre>
pip install dupechecker
</pre>



## Usage

<pre>
>dupechecker -h

usage: dupechecker [-h] [-r] [-i [IGNORES ...]] [-d] [-ad] [-ns] [paths ...]

positional arguments:
  paths                 The paths to compare files in.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r, --recursive       Glob files to compare recursively.
  -i [IGNORES ...], --ignores [IGNORES ...]
                        Ignore files matching these patterns. e.g. `dupechecker -i *.wav` will compare all files in the current working directory except .wav files.
  -d, --delete_dupes    After finding duplicates, delete all but one copy. For each set of duplicates, the tool will ask you to enter the number corresponding to the copy you want to keep. Pressing 'enter' without entering a number will skip that set without deleting anything.
  -ad, --autodelete     Automatically decide which file to keep and which to delete from each set of duplicate files instead of asking which to keep.
  -ns, --no_show        Don't show printout of matching files.

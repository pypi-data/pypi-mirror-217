# Cmake meets setuptools


## Try the example

The example module `foo` contains the methods `add` and `inverse`.
The `inverse` method is part of an external C/C++ library against
which is linked after module compilation.

### Build the example module
```bash
cd example
```

```bash
python3 setup.py bdist_wheel # build as wheel
python3 setup.py build_ext -i # build in-place
```

### Test the example module
```bash
python3 -c "import foo; print(foo.inverse(0.5))"
```

This should compile the static library `deadbeef`,
compile the `foo.bar` submodule and print `2.0` upon execution.

# Usage example for the procedure PPXF, which implements the
# Penalized Pixel-Fitting (pPXF) method originally described in
# Cappellari M., & Emsellem E., 2004, PASP, 116, 138
#     http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004PASP..116..138C
# and upgraded in Cappellari M., 2017, MNRAS, 466, 798
#     http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.466..798C
#
# The example also shows how to include a library of templates
# and how to mask gas emission lines if present.
# The example is specialized for a fit to a SDSS spectrum.

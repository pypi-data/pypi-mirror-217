    Multiple jumps, such as a double or triple jump,
    require you to pay attention, as the convention is
    to just show the start and end squares and not the
    in-between or intermediate squares. So the notation
    1-3 would mean a King does a double jump from 1 to 10 to 3.
    The intermediate square is only shown if there are two ways
    to jump and it would not be clear otherwise.

    n - 2 - number of captured pieces

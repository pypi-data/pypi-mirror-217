**scikit-tree**
===================
Scikit-tree is a package for modern tree-based algorithms for supervised and unsupervised
learning problems. It extends the robust API of `scikit-learn <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn>`_
for tree algorithms that achieve strong performance in benchmark tasks.

We encourage you to use the package for your research and also build on top
with relevant Pull Requests. See our examples for walk-throughs of how to use the package.
Also, see our `contributing guide <https://github.com/neurodata/scikit-tree/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.

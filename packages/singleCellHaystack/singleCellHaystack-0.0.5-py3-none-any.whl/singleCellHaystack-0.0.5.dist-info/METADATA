This repository contains a Python implementation of [singleCellHaystack](https://github.com/alexisvdb/singleCellHaystack) (version >= 1.0.0).

This package is currently in beta. The most important functionality in the R package works, but some features are not yet available. Here is a (probably imcomplete) list of missing features. Some will be added in the future.

* `weights.advanced.Q` (formerly known as `use.advanced.sampling`).
* `seeding` method for calculating grid points.
* Hierarchical clustering method for `cluster_genes`.

# Installation

You can install singleCellHaystack from [pypi](https://pypi.org):

```
pip install singleCellHaystack
```

You can install singleCellHaystack from GitHub with:

```
pip install git+http://github.com/ddiez/singleCellHaystack-py
```

>Support for conda installation will be added in the future.

# Example

```
import scanpy as sc
import singleCellHaystack as hs

adata = sc.read_h5ad("data.h5ad")

[... process adata object ...]

res = hs.haystack(adata, coord="pca")
res.top_features(n=10)
```

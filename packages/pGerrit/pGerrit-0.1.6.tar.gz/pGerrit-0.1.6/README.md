## Summary
**pGerrit** is a lightweight Python library for calling Gerrit's [REST API](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/rest-api.html). Essentially, pGerrit is designed to make it easy to access the REST API and retrieve relevant data, much like accessing properties of classes and objects.

Complete project documentation can be found at [here](https://pgerrit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
<!-- END-RTD-IGNORE -->

## Features
* üç∞ **Clear design:** Every REST API endpoint is a class. Every entity of the endpoint is an object
* üöÄ **Easy of use** You can access the state of entity by access the property of the object
* ‚öôÔ∏è **PyCharm Autocomplete Support** Adapted for PyCharm's auto-completion. Next step we will support response autocomplete

## Quickstart

### Installation
```bash
pip install pGerrit
```

### Run the code
Run the code below
```python
from pGerrit.client import GerritClient

client = GerritClient("https://android-review.googlesource.com/")
change = client.change("1285870")
detail = change.detail()

print("")
print("branch name: " + detail.branch)
print("project name: " + detail.project)
print("created time: " + detail.created)
print("updated time: " + detail.updated)
print("")
print("Check this url to make sure info above is correct")
print("https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/support/+/1285870")
```

## Tips

### Chinese users
For Chinese users, Google is blocked by GFW. So you may need a proxy or VPN to get code above to work.
If you'd like to try this on your private Gerrit, you may need to pass `username` and `http_password` to `GerritClient` class. Check [document](https://pgerrit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/#use-it-on-private-gerrit) here.

### The snippet above hangs there
If this code snippet hangs there and return after 2 minutes. You can try `wget https://android-review.googlesource.com`. If it also hangs there, you probably enabled your ipv6 but your ISP doesn't provide you corresponding services.
You can [disable ipv6](https://itsfoss.com/disable-ipv6-ubuntu-linux/) by following command:
```bash
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6=1

sudo sysctl -p
```

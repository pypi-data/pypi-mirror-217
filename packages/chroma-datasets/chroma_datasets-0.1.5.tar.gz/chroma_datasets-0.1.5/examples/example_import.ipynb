In other words. Yeah, you do need to be kind of moving against a very heavy load. Now, again, that can look very different depending on your level of experience. Like, I really like deadlifting. Now. I can count the number of days left in my life when I'm going to want to do sets over £400, but I'll pick and choose the days that I do. But I grew up doing those things. I'm comfortable with those movements. If I had a 60 year old woman who's never lifted weights in her life, who we now have to get lifting, I mean, we could get her to Deadlift, but I think I wouldn't make perfect the enemy of good. I'd be happy to put her on a leg press machine and just get her doing that. It's not as pure a movement as a deadlift, but who cares, right? We can still put her at a heavy load for her and do so safely.\\n\\nPeter Attia: Now, that said, there was a study that was done in Australia and hopefully we can find a link to it. There's a video on YouTube that actually kind of has the pi sort of walking through the results. I could send it to you.\\n\\nAndrew Huberman: Okay. Yeah.\\n\\nPeter Attia: And it's just amazing. They took a group of older women, they look like they're in their 60s or 70s, who had never lifted weights in their life, who had osteopenia, and some probably already had osteoporosis, and they basically just put them on a strength training protocol. And it is remarkable to watch these women. They're doing good mornings, they're doing deadlifts, they're picking heavy things up off the ground. I think one woman was picking up god, I want to say she was like, picking like 50, 60 kilos up off the ground. I mean, just staggering sums of weight for these women who have never done anything. And their bone health is improving at this age. So the goal, frankly, is to just never get to the point where you have to do this for the first time. Strength training is such an essential part of our existence that it's never too late to start, but you should peter, stop.\"]], 'metadatas': [[{'chunkTitle': 'Strength Training Benefits', 'episodeTitle': 'Dr. Peter Attia: Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones for Vitality & Longevity | Huberman Lab Podcast #85', 'imgUrl': 'https://img.youtube.com/vi/DTCmprPCDqc/maxresdefault.jpg', 'published': '2022-08-15T00:00:00+00:00', 'url': 'https://dexa.ai/huberman/episodes/doc_2065?sectionSid=sec_29166&chunkSid=chunk_57977'}]], 'distances': [[0.32776644825935364]]}\n"
